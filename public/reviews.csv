College ,2024-04-08,5,Airbnb,,"The house matches the photos well. The place was clean and conveniently located to downtown. There's no smart lock on the front door (only the back) which made it a little awkward to get into the first time, but after figuring it out it wasn't a big deal."
6115 Ralston,2024-03-27,5,Airbnb,,We had a wonderful stay and really enjoyed the location.
Morris ,2024-11-03,4,Airbnb,,"Great location, 20 min walk 5 min drive to Lucas Oil Stadium. The house was clean and modern. However the upstairs bed frame was squeaky and the mattresses were hard. There was a wasp upstairs. Luckily we didn't get stung. Overall great place for our family."

4452 Carrollton,2023-10-16,5,Airbnb,,"Our stay here was exactly what we needed. We are southsiders who planned a wedding at a nearby venue and needed a place to stay for a few days and a spot for we (two brides) and a few family members to get ready before our ceremony. With one bathroom upstairs and one downstairs, this place was the perfect spot for us to do hair/makeup/attire without seeing one another. We will remember this house forever as the backdrop for the first days of our marriage, where our niece/flower girl played the piano while we all got ready and where we discovered that our beagle loves beanbag chairs."

Would definitely stay here again if we were in town."
Evanston ,2024-12-06,5,Vrbo,A Good Stay In Indy,"We chose this VRBO as our home base for a weekend in Indy to see friends. It was spacious, clean, had a fenced in yard which was great for our dog, and was pretty close to everything we wanted to do. The property management company did a great job of communicating and the verification process to stay made me feel like this place was very legit. We enjoyed this little place and would stay here again. "

Woodland,2024-10-27,5,Airbnb,,"Easy to find and easy to get inside.  Very smooth stay, in town for kid’s softball games.<br/>One suggestion - “sofa bed” should read “futon.”  Hypothetically, my 73-year-old mother can sleep on “sofa beds.”  She could not have slept on the futon in the living room. <br/>Everything else was great"
5827 North College,2022-06-26,5,Airbnb,,"A beautifully decorated, super clean, and charming home in a great location! Everything is the highest quality… bed linens, towels, soaps, kitchenware, etc. Enjoyed having a cappuccino in the morning and a glass of wine in the evening. A lovely neighborhood to walk through and down to Broad Ripple for restaurants and shops. Easy drive to Grand Park for our soccer tournament. Excellent communication from Kathy who thought of every detail. Will look for this again our next time in Indy!"
2834 N. Washington ,2023-03-28,5,Airbnb,,all want to say is thank you Gabriel for giving this opportunity stay Thank you for making your home our home.

1230 Union Street,2024-09-30,4,Airbnb,,"This house was so great for our family when we were in town for a colts game. Only a 20 min walk to the stadium!! The house is stunning too. They did a great job remodeling.<br/>Spare room was great for our son and pack n play was wonderful to have for our baby in the basement. Our baby could honestly fit in the closet and another couple could have slept in the basement!<br/>I only gave 4 stars because the floors needed to be cleaned better and the neighbors dogs were loud our first night. We both even considered not staying the second night. We slept just a few hours. It was pretty awful honestly. Roosters and chickens actually weren’t loud at all! However we both slept better the second night, so can’t say for certain how loud the dogs typically are. I am also a light sleeper. I’m not sure if we’d stay here again. With ear plugs - then probably."
Unit 262,2023-05-01,5,Airbnb,,Great Stay! Nice location!

Carson,2024-12-28,4,Airbnb,,"Everything was cleaned well, including the towels, linens, and surfaces. We also received clear instructions for check in and the check out expectations were reasonable. Unfortunately, the neighborhood is rundown (dumpsters overflowed, it’s not well lit) and the house is in need of some repairs (there’s wear and tear, e.g. scuff marks and dents on doors, upstairs shower backs up)."
135 Hillcrest ,2024-04-03,4,Airbnb,,There was plenty of space for the 8 of us and they had a charming complimentary coffee and tea station. Brentwood was very kind and responsive when we expressed concerns about the bedding arrangements and some cleanliness. We arrived on Saturday and they wouldn’t have anyone available to address our concerns until Monday morning. We agreed on a partial refund to address the concerns. Throughout our stay Brentwood kept in touch and was courteous to our needs.

Morris ,2024-12-29,5,Airbnb,,Wonderful stay. Everything was exactly how it showed in the pictures.
30 Village Court,2024-08-06,5,Airbnb,,Perfect location for Great Lakes Regional Baseball Tournament. <br/>Plenty of space inside to relax. <br/>Quick responses for questions asked. <br/>Needs shrubbery trimmed to have an attractive curb appeal. <br/>Full size coffee pot needed for large group. <br/>Grab bars in shower would be nice for elderly.

Evanston ,2024-05-17,5,Airbnb,,"we stayed here for 3 weeks and from the minute we walked in to this extremely clean home, we felt right at home. any questions we had were addressed immediately.  very quiet and safe area. the back yard very private and deck was large and roomy. centrally located to many locations, which was a huge plus. this home is highly recommended. and if the need arises, we definitely will book here again"
1123 Olive St.,2025-01-20,5,Airbnb,,Great stay. Accurate description. Beautiful home.
44 S Holmes,2024-07-22,5,Airbnb,,"The place is amazing. It’s so clean and smells great. One thing I am always impressed with is soft towels-they always get crunchy or just aren’t soft. The only complaint I have about the place is the beds. It would be worth it to upgrade—just have good protection on the mattress with a topper or protector. The beds were hard as a rock slightly too small (maybe both should be queens). The location is not the greatest. This side of town seems pretty run down, but boy oh boy do they have Mexican restaurants out the wazoo 🤣 overall we had a great stay!"
30 Village Court,2023-04-09,5,Airbnb,,Perfect place to stay when we was in town for business. We booked this property kind of last minute and the host was very helpful and responsive to any questions or concerns that I had. The house was very clean and we felt right at home.  I would stay here again no problem if we are back in town.
Unit 110,2023-08-01,5,Airbnb,,Smooth stay in Indianapolis. Highly recommend Brentwood’s properties for their excellent customer experience.

135 Hillcrest ,2023-06-11,4,Airbnb,,The place was clean and had enough space for 6 of us. The location was great. They were timely about getting back to us when we had an issue with the WiFi.
Pleasant ,2025-01-04,5,Airbnb,,"This was a fantastic place for our family of 10 (5 adults, 5 kids) to gather to celebrate Christmas. Plenty of bedrooms and the kids had a blast in the basement game room allowing the adults to visit upstairs. The large kitchen was great for meals together. The only negative was that since it was winter, we did not get to experience the outdoor spaces. We are hoping to return when the weather is warmer."
2836 N. Washington ,2025-02-09,5,Airbnb,,Love living room and bathroom and nice shower make us become peaceful
4452 Carrollton,2024-07-07,5,Airbnb,,"Quiet setting, close to everything and being pet friendly was awesome for a pet parent like myself. Thank you for providing a safe and clean environment."
Morris ,2024-08-04,5,Airbnb,,"Lots of space and modern throughout the inside. Plenty of bed space for everyone. The road can be a bit noisy during rush hour times during the week. The kitchen was well stocked and had chips and breakfast foods with coffee. The bathroom had all the amenities including soap, towels, and hairdryers."
848 Camp St,2024-06-07,5,Airbnb,,"Wir waren eine Gruppe von Kollegen die dieses Haus für ein paar Tage gemietet haben. Die Kommunikation mit den Gastgebern lief reibungslos und war immer sehr freundlich, geantwortet wurde sehr schnell.<br/>Die Unterkunft war sehr sauber und gut ausgestattet. Die Wohngegend war ruhig und wir fühlten uns sicher. Zum Canal Walk war es nicht weit.<br/>Alles in allem waren wir sehr zufrieden und haben unsere Zeit in Indianapolis sehr genossen."
Evanston ,2023-12-27,5,Airbnb,,Great stay in Indy!
Gandy,2024-10-07,1,Airbnb,,"After checkout you are charged with damages. Cleaning fees and new mattress charge for Urine, when in fact it was sweat from poor HVAC.  Bedrooms didn't get nearly as cold as living room where thermostat was located.  Water leaked from dishwasher excessively.  Make you sign and entire other contract beyond Air BnB contract.  Don't recommend."
5827 North College,2018-05-28,5,Airbnb,,Kathy was an amazing host! We felt so welcomed in her home. Highly recommend this stay!
1232 Union Street,2024-09-23,5,Airbnb,,"Great house, good location! Very good experience!"

6140 Winthrop ,2024-07-15,4,Airbnb,,"Easy access to restaurants, bars, and greenway."
30 Village Court,2023-04-02,5,Airbnb,,"It is a beautiful house located in a peaceful neighborhood. The house was very clean and has a beautiful minimalistic decoration (ideal if you have kids), looks exactly like the pictures so for sure you WON’T get unpleasant surprises. The kitchen has all the features you would need in your stay. <br/>Beds equipped with a lot of pillows, soft sheets and warm duvets. If you stay with little kids I would recommend bring their small pillows because the ones the house has are kinda big for them. <br/>Gabriel was a great host, very responsive. <br/>I highly recommend this place to stay."
Unit 262,2023-03-02,5,Airbnb,,Everything was great...loved the convenient location of this place
Pleasant ,2024-06-12,5,Airbnb,,Very clean and beautiful Airbnb. One of the best I’ve been to. We enjoyed the outside patio and slept comfortably in the beds. The location was only 10-15 minutes from downtown. Some great coffee spots nearby. Definitely would visit again if we returned to Indianapolis.
4452 Carrollton,2023-08-20,5,Airbnb,,"Host really helped us out of a jam last minute with another listing that we could not stay in because of my son. This place is exceptionally clean and location is centralized. SoBro is the new Broad Ripple, and this place is right at the flashpoint of the neighborhood. Definitely recommend for the city savvy adventurer type who avoids tourist trap areas. This place is the Crayola 64 box of Indy’s local color. :)"
4452 Carrollton,2022-11-19,4,Airbnb,,"Great place to stay, incredible value and wonderful guide on the mantle for both the rental and the neighborhood. We were especially impressed with the yard, porch and kitchen."
Gandy,2023-08-13,5,Airbnb,,"Quick and easy, great location!"

1301 Ringgold,2024-10-05,5,Vrbo,Perfect Spot!,"Great property in a cool part of town.  Owners were fantastic and very responsive.  Stress free process, start to finish.  Only problem was I wish that I had more time for the hot tub!   "
1301 Ringgold,2024-10-06,5,Airbnb,,Overall this was a great stay and I really enjoyed the home. Some issues with the amenities but not much to complain about. I will say make sure to bring your own “essentials” we had to run to the dollar store for some minor things.
Unit 110,2024-05-19,5,Airbnb,,"location is terrible, place is exactly what is in the photos"
Mitchell St,2024-11-16,5,Vrbo,Mother/Daughters Annual Shopping Trip ,Nice comfortable home. Plenty of outlets. Easy front door lock pad. Easy checkout.

Brentwood Property Group,2023-04-05,5,Google,,"Gabe and Brentwood is amazing! Makes your life as an AirBnb owner so simple. His attention to detail is excellent and it shows in customer testimonies, the experience he creates for them is one of a kind. Highly recommend the best property manager in Indiana!"
Unit 262,2023-01-20,5,Airbnb,,Gabriel was very nice and responsive even at midnight. He came by to fix the keypad immediately when we messaged him that it wasn’t working. I truly would recommend and would definitely be staying here the bedtime I’m in Indiana
Sanders,2024-08-25,5,Airbnb,,Great place to stay for a week while we were working in the city. Thank you very much.
Puntledge,2024-01-01,5,Airbnb,,"A lovely, well kept home, plenty of space for what we needed, a rest bit for an unexpected stay, glad to find a home for our week with family when more space was needed, the kitchen had many of the items needed while away, clean bathrooms, comfy beds"
135 Hillcrest ,2024-11-17,5,Airbnb,,Very nice and enjoyable stay!
Unit 110,2023-04-23,5,Airbnb,,the neighbors are kind of loud but everyone calms down in the evening. lots of apartment type noises so if you aren't used to that it could bug you. the unit was comfortable but the bed was a little uncomfortable to me. AC unit was in kitchen but did a decent job keeping the entire place at a comfortable temp. Gabriel was courteous and provided many different comforts at his place. Would stay again. 👍
N. New Jersey ,2023-02-17,5,Airbnb,,"House was beautiful, and fir our weekend plans perfectly!"
4452 Carrollton,2022-11-05,5,Airbnb,,Definitely one of the best places you could stay in Indianapolis. yhe house is amazing and it has everything you need and more. If you want the best bang for your buck this is definitely the place you want to stay in the only thing that could of made it better was curtains or blinds in the living room to help with privacy during the evening hours.
1123 Olive St.,2024-10-19,5,Vrbo,Indy,Wonderful home! 
Brentwood Property Group,2024-01-25,5,Google,,
Fess Ave,2024-06-11,5,Airbnb,,Very nice to sit in the backyard and enjoyed the neighborhood. Dears would come right up to the porch. It was really cool. We enjoyed our stay.
Lake Ridge,2024-09-29,4,Airbnb,,"There was an issue that was out of Brentwood’s control. We communicated it and they acted swiftly and remedied the situation. If not for that, it would have been a 5-star stay. Also the weather was rainy - which obviously no one can control - so while the surrounding area looks beautiful, we did not get to enjoy it. The bed is super comfy and the place itself was clean and well appointed. I would recommend it for sure!"
135 Hillcrest ,2024-08-13,5,Airbnb,,Great location helpful hosts. We had a problem with the coffee pot not working and a new one was delivered immediately.
2836 N. Washington ,2023-06-16,5,Airbnb,,Very responsive and they were easy to work with given special circumstances that arose.  Thank you!
Union Carriage House,2025-03-30,5,Airbnb,,"I loved having a garage available for my car and the apartment we stayed in above was so neat! New build obviously, but super clean, and had everything we needed for our weekend stay! We were within walking distance to Lucas Oil Stadium - less than a mile. The price point was affordable and it was a great find last minute. I believe we booked a week ahead before our stay, so I was surprised to find something so close to downtown & for such a great price. The owners communicated with us daily & kept in touch. They were super accommodating! Would stay here again if we visit Indy anytime soon."
Mitchell St,2024-08-05,5,Airbnb,,This is one of the nicest airbnb’s I’ve stayed in . I stayed here for work with 3 other people from Tennessee & it served us well. The best part was I saw deer almost every morning & evening grazing through the yard & neighborhood . It’s a nice neighborhood & I felt at home there . I will definitely try to stay here again when I come back .
2836 N. Washington ,2023-04-08,5,Airbnb,,Great home in a super convenient location! Gabriel was easy to get in touch with for questions and was always responsive! 10/10!!!
848 Camp St,2024-10-26,5,Airbnb,,We had a pleasant stay and enjoyed the accommodations.
Colere Place,2025-03-10,5,Airbnb,,Great place to stay!
1230 Union Street,2023-09-17,3,Airbnb,,It was very clean and nice on the inside but there seems to be dog breeding going on next door and it was very loud. We didn’t know about the area and it’s not a good location due to drug activity and the water in the showers didn’t get warm/hot.
Mitchell St,2024-08-17,3,Airbnb,,Not a five star stay. The location is great. The house is very musty. The closets did not look like they had been painted and smelled very badly. The floors had not been cleaned. We were given one towel and wash cloth each and one hand towel to share between all of us for a 10 day stay. When I reached out to the property management group for more-so I would not have to do laundry every day-they responded that that’s why they gave laundry detergent and reminded me it wasn’t a hotel. They don’t leave towels like a hotel. They said they would reach out to the cleaning company to see what they could do but apparently they couldn’t do anything because I never heard back. The back porch was full of leaves and spider webs- we didn’t use the ping pong table. The neighborhood is very walkable. That’s the only 5 star thing about the place.
5827 North College,2019-11-25,5,Airbnb,,"The accommodations at Kathy’s place were clean, comfortable, and convenient but that was expected. What made the stay better than expected was meeting Kathy and enjoying the relaxed calm she has created in her home. Definitely would stay again."
1232 Union Street,2024-08-04,5,Airbnb,,Brentwood were great to work with.  Very responsive and receptive of our questions and concerns all the way through.  Would work with them again.
Grandview,2023-11-27,5,Airbnb,,Very spacious!  Great location.  Responsive host
Mitchell St,2024-06-27,5,Airbnb,,"The house and hosts were wonderful! We had a few questions and the communication was always prompt and helpful. House was clean and in a great location. Bloomington got rocked with storms and we were without power for 2 nights. Totally out of the control of the hosts, yet they were still were helpful. Highly recommend this house or other houses by this host ☺️"
Sanders,2024-06-12,5,Airbnb,,Host was very proactive when giving instructions. The place was great and exactly what we needed for our stay in Indianapolis.
5827 North College,2019-02-04,5,Airbnb,,"Kathy is an amazing host!  Her house is in a fantastic centrally located area near Broad Ripple.  I had meetings all over the city during my stay and was quickly and easily able to get to them from Kathy's place.  Her street is right near tons of great bars and restaurants, with central Broad Ripple a ten minute walk away.<br/>She has a beautiful old house with a ton of character.  Room was sparkling clean and Kathy and her daughter provide the bathroom upstairs to their guests, so you are not sharing it with anyone else.  Their dog Mac was super friendly, and would snuggle up next to me while i was working on the couch, so if you love dogs like I do, this is the spot for you!  Kathy also left me fresh brewed coffee, bagels, and yogurt for breakfast each morning, a nice touch.  Highly recommended!<br/>  W"
5827 North College,2020-06-21,5,Airbnb,,Kathy was super nice and her home was beautiful. It is an updated older home that is in a great location. As with many other older homes the floors are a bit noisy and the walls are a little thin but we would reccomend this place for anyone looking for a great place to stay.
Senour,2025-03-01,1,Airbnb,,"Given the extensive contract received by the Airbnb host, I would expect the host hold itself to the same standard of those who stay at their property. Unfortunately, that was not the case. This was one of the dirtiest Airbnb’s we have ever stayed in. The floors were filthy. The bathroom doesn’t look like it’s been cleaned in months with rings around the toilet and in the tub. Bugs were present. It was very obvious they do not clean or have a professional cleaner. It could be because there is a for sale sign in the yard but that’s no excuse to half do your hosting when people are paying good money to stay here."
6140 Winthrop ,2023-06-16,5,Airbnb,,Absolutely enjoyed our stay. Very nice airbnb.  Porch is beautiful. House is beautifully decorated. Specially all material kept for use was of high quality. We found everything we needed. Very safe area. Close to Monontrail. Parking space is good.  Very clean.
30 Village Court,2023-06-22,5,Airbnb,,We enjoyed our stay very much!! The house was very clean and has a  fresh uncluttered feeling I loved.

We got to the home and realized we forgot our leashes with the poop bags on them, so we were very happy that the owners included a poop bag dispenser on the fence outside.

42 S Holmes,2024-11-03,4,Airbnb,,"Place looked just like the photos. Was convenient to get to the heart of the city via car. Not the fault of the owner, but a few things to note for future renters: this place was very noisy, inside you could hear everything in the other duplex, their iPhone alarm woke us up. Outside you’re less than a block from a very active train track, there are lots of barking dogs, and some neighbor had chickens including crowing roosters all day long."

1230 Union Street,2025-01-20,1,Vrbo,,"So first off getting there was easy. Parking up front the first day was available. We got in and tried to set up the air mattress but to our surprise there was a huge hole in it. I reached out to the property and this is the response “ I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience regarding the Internet and the air mattress. We will address these issues promptly.” the issue wasn’t addressed and we found out only a few hours after checking in. Nothing was resolved Thursday when it happened and Monday still no new update. Also the Internet was out for 2 out 4 nights we had booked. The walls are paper thin and we could hear the neighbors running up and down the stairs and the baby cry all night long. There is a train that passes by that was loud but we were up already so it wasn’t too bad. Hot water ran out after 2 showers. It definitely did not sleep 6, beds were hard and I could feel the metal frame underneath. "
Southridge,2024-06-24,4,Airbnb,,We loved the clean interior. We appreciated the host's responsiveness. Quiet neighborhood. Only thing is the exterior could use some landscaping maintenance. Exterior did not match the interior. Walkable to downtown Westfield and biking trails.

Gabriel reached out to me several time before and while I was there to check on us and make sure we had everything we need. He’s such a great host. Highly recommend staying at one of his properties and I will definitely be booking with him again.. thanks for everything Gabriel!!!
Pleasant ,2024-04-19,5,Airbnb,,"The house was the perfect setup for a group of coworkers! We were in town for a conference and hotel prices can be absurd. Our stay was affordable and had incredible amenities and common areas for us to enjoy. We are used to being cooped up in our small rooms outside of conference show hours which made the idea of an airbnb so appealing. The layout and ratio of rooms to bathrooms made it easy for a large group to stay comfortably and get ready quickly - huge plus! The rooftop bar was a serious game changer and a unique feature. The neighborhood is a little rough but we made sure to be respectful and the neighbors kept to themselves. Home Base has done a nice job of fortifying the property so, once inside, feels incredibly safe."
Lake Ridge,2024-10-22,4,Vrbo,Clean and Beatiful area,"Condo was clean and is in a beautiful, quiet and peaceful area.  It is an older unit and getting a little worn and dated but everything worked and was very clean.  We would stay again."

Washington ,2024-09-30,5,Vrbo,"Clean, comfortable, accurate description","The initial task of getting into the property was daunting (it was pouring down rain, dark, and we could not see the house number in front...we had to check the mail laying on the porch to see if it was the correct address.  Then drove around back, saw the number, but the code wouldn't work in back, only in front).  

After that...wonderful.  Very, very clean, even had snacks and cereal bars waiting for us.  The Keurig was provided with K-cups, always an appreciated touch.  TV's in the bedrooms were on ""guest mode"", which was a bit annoying...we couldn't access much of anything on those, but the tv downstairs worked well.  Comfortable beds, clean bathrooms...we would stay here again!"
Sanders,2023-07-24,5,Airbnb,,"This was an excellent house to stay in. There is a lovely patio and garage to park the car.

The home itself is well-appointed without feeling stuffy. It's filled with thoughtful amenities like bidets in two of the 2.5 bathrooms, a wine fridge, and a glorious kitchen stocked with almost everything cooks might need. The basement - while requiring a careful trek down some steep stairs (as one should expect in houses of a certain age) - is cozy, comfortable, and quiet for work or watching a movie. The backyard provided plenty of space for our two dogs to run and explore. We felt right at home and hope to stay again in years to come!"

The house is just like the photos. The beds are really comfortable. Feels homey. As stated in the the description, its in an up and coming neighborhood.

Kathy is the perfect example of my hometown Indiana's Hoosier Hospitality! Met me at the door and gave me a tour of her home and my living quarters. She goes out of her way to make you feel like the whole (beautiful) home is all yours. Her back yard is a space to sit, lean back and take in those magnificent hardwood trees. Oh, and before you chill out, be sure to walk two blocks down the street and pick up some wine at the new wine shop. Perfect location, laid back atmosphere, and did I mention, a great host!

Please note if u are sensitive to scents, they use 4 huge room deodorizers throughout this small house."
42 S Holmes,2024-10-06,5,Airbnb,,"The accommodations were quite comfortable and had a homely feel. However, due to the shared walls of the duplex, we could hear the guests in the neighboring unit throughout the night.

Fess Ave,2024-11-22,5,Airbnb,,"This property was exactly what we needed. We had just sold our house,  were in between homes, and needed something in the city. The house is 200 feet from Bryan park which was perfect for our toddler, and walkable to several shops/cafes.<br/>The kitchenware was fully stocked, and there were plenty of towels. We loved having laundry onsite and the range in the kitchen.<br/>I will say that the home could use a good deep clean, there were lots of cobwebs on the walls and ceilings, but everything else was quite clean. It is smaller and slightly more cramped than the photos make it appear. The back porch was really nice, and the TV and WiFi were easy to figure out. We really enjoyed our stay :)"

-Pet friendly! I appreciated that we could take my dog and felt he was very safe in this setting. 
-Hosts were quick to respond to questions and proactively asked if we needed anything after arrival. It was a sweet surprise to find that a few snacks and treats were left for us as well as coffee, creamer and sugar. 

Seriously, this was one of the best properties we have ever rented!"
341 Parkway,2024-07-17,5,Airbnb,,"First, the hosts are very responsive, open to suggestions and keeps their property clean. There are a lot of cats in the neighborhood that are extremely friendly which the kids enjoyed. They had games to play and everything was awesome with appliances and bedrooms.  I had an accident with the garage which they fixed right away and the charge to have it fixed was reasonable. If you have a big car like an explorer park out front making the turn into the garage can judge the space. The place is walkable to a few places, close the highways, and 5 to 7 mins from supermarkets and corner stores"
10th St,2024-08-04,4,Airbnb,,"Super clean, cute place that’s a quick walk to Mass Ave/the Bottleworks area. The host is super responsive and helpful. I had a bunch of questions and asks for them and they always replied very quickly with offers of help, solutions, etc. The bed is super comfy. Great stuff!"
1301 Ringgold,2025-04-11,5,Airbnb,,"The owners were extremely responsive and very pleasant. I did report some minor cleanliness issues so that they could communicate them with their cleaning crew. These issues were no fault of their own and I did report believe that they will absolutely address them based on our experience together.  I also found that there was no water pressure in the second upstairs bedroom but it was a lovely place, very private and quite. Close to downtown and near some great restaurants."
N. New Jersey ,2024-05-12,5,Airbnb,,"Beautiful and spacious home. Beds were super comfy!! House is close to interstate, so you can hear traffic overnight, but we got used to it."

44 S Holmes,2024-11-25,3,Airbnb,,The area is very run down and the parking was complicated.  The alley was often blocked and the street in front was crowded.  The train is nearby and runs throughout the night.
1123 Olive St.,2024-09-23,5,Airbnb,,"this property has the 5 star feel and look, and also the perfect location,  surrounding bars, and restaurants, attentive host. 5 bedrooms with one being for small kids or humans,  everything is new. our group travels the US about 3xs a year,  and we have stayed in indy about 7xs in the past 3 years and this property is by far the best, we even canceled reservations at a restaurant to stay and cook at the house just to enjoy it even more.... with all of this said this is the best of the best air bnbs, and price was worth every penny. I will be back for sure"
Primrose Ave,2024-07-14,5,Airbnb,,"The property was accurately represented - it’s a clean and comfortable older home, in a quiet and safe residential neighborhood. Worked out perfectly for our visit with nearby family. Brentwood was proactive and positive in communicating with us - before, during, and after. Overall a smooth and positive experience!"

5827 North College,2024-06-16,5,Airbnb,,"Everything exceeded our expectations. The California vibe may not be for everybody, but we absolutely loved it and thought it was executed with perfection. The home was equipped beyond our expectation, the beds extremely comfortable, linens top-notch, and the kitchen outfitted surprisingly well. It felt like home immediately. Kathy was extremely proactive, addressing our needs and preferences, even before our arrival."
2836 N. Washington ,2023-07-16,5,Airbnb,,"The house was exactly as described and photos accurate.  Very clean, updated and cozy with 6 guests (3 dads and 3 daughters in town for a LAX tournament up at Grand Park).  Appreciated the TV's in each room and all the amenities.  Washed their uniforms each night.  Had no issues during stay and management did great communicating before and during stay.  I would have no issues returning to this location. We sat on the front porch one evening and the neighbors were friendly."
Primrose Ave,2024-07-18,4,Vrbo,Great little place for a few days.,"We enjoyed our short stay here. Comfy beds, lots of little extras, like shampoo (etc), snacks and coffee. The neighborhood looks like it could be a little dodgy when you first pull in, but we didn’t have any issues. Lots of people were out walking which made us feel better."
Puntledge,2023-06-25,5,Airbnb,,Place was great for us it was close to the baseball fields and get food and entertainment.
1232 Union Street,2024-06-24,5,Airbnb,,Exactly as pictured. More than enough space for 3 adults and 2 kids.   Easy walk to the Stadium and downtown area.

We had plenty of room to relax; and all the amenities made our stay comfortable and enjoyable.<br/>We were absolutely in love with everything about the kitchen and the design aesthetic is impeccable. You can tell how thoughtfully it was designed and all the faucet fixtures & floorings are great quality.<br/>Everthing felt clean and The Brentwood Team were quick with responding. Would highly recommend!
Evanston ,2023-04-24,5,Airbnb,,"Our stay was great my family loved it. even had a fenced in yard for the dog. pictures matched, had a problem with the water but they came and fixed it immediately. Check in and check out was easy very simple and flexible. I definitely would recommend. 9/10 5 stars for-sure"
Union Carriage House,2025-02-02,5,Airbnb,,"We stayed for the WWE Royal Rumble and very much enjoyed our stay. It was a cute space with everything we needed for our stay. We may have been confused as to where our rental was, but they were so helpful in making sure we were able to get there and get in. Loved that we were able to park our car as we were able to walk to Lucas Oil Stadium! Will be back for WrestleMania!"
N. New Jersey ,2024-05-17,5,Airbnb,,"What a great week we had! My team and I were in town for a conference and this was the perfect place for us. Two bedrooms had bathrooms and then another 1.5 bathrooms. The kitchen was great, plenty of space. The owners were responsive and accommodating! We will definitely stay here again for the next conference."

4452 Carrollton,2024-08-01,5,Airbnb,,"Very nicoe place, accurate description, very thoughtful interior and amenities. Nice fenced in back yard. Up and coming trendy neighborhood with lots of places to eat. Some homes remain sketchy but sure this will change over time. Some trouble with the remote door locks but host very responsive and quick solution found. Would stay there again."
Unit 262,2023-03-19,5,Airbnb,,Literally has everything you need besides some shot glasses throw in some shot glasses and everything would’ve been perfect 👍🏽
30 Village Court,2023-07-24,4,Airbnb,,Close to the venue we were there for. . Instructions were clear
5827 North College,2024-06-22,5,Airbnb,,"We loved our stay in Kathy's home! The surf vibe and eclectic decor were fun and the house was spotless. We enjoyed spending time in the private and quiet backyard and you must be sure to take walk in the neighborhood. Check in and check out were a breeze. Very reasonable check out instructions! Kathy's home exceeded all of our expectations and this was easily one of our favorite stays. Thanks for everything, Kathy!"
Evanston ,2023-12-04,5,Airbnb,,"Stylish bungalow is a clean & cute 2BR mid-century style home. It had everything I needed and was in a quiet, eclectic neighborhood with easy street parking to boot. If you like MCM and vintage style charm in a convenient Indy neighborhood, this one is for you."
Puntledge,2024-06-14,5,Airbnb,,This was the perfect AirBnb for the groomsmen for a few days leading up to a wedding. The host was responsive and accommodating. And there were enough beds to sleep all six of us comfortably!

Her home is beautiful, sparkling clean, and in such a fun location! Kathy totally exceeded my expectations! Would recommend to anyone looking to stay in the area. Also, her dog is super sweet."
330 E Caven,2023-09-23,5,Airbnb,,"What can I say, the place was everything we ever wanted in a stay away from home. The home was literally so comfortable and spacious! Our family loved every moment there to say the least. One thing I would recommend is for the master bedroom to have at least a sitting chair for two and the other rooms at least one chair for sitting as well. As for cleanliness, there was only one concern, that the home really needed to be swept, the floors were not clean. Thankfully there was a vacuum and broom and we sure made use of it. Overall, everything else was exceptional!!!!! We loved our stay. The home was beautiful."
Colere Place,2025-03-16,5,Airbnb,,"Brentwood was a great host who helped my travel party feel right at home. If we go back to Indy, we will look for a Brentwood hosted property!"
5827 North College,2018-09-23,5,Airbnb,,"Beautiful, elegant and stylish home in a perfect location. My stay was effortless and very comfortable."
N. New Jersey ,2023-10-06,5,Airbnb,,Me and 3 other co-workers arrived and were very happy with what we found. We all felt at home and loved the location. If we return to the area we will definitely try to book this home again. This is a very well put together property. 5 Stars!!
Puntledge,2023-06-03,3,Airbnb,,"Gabe and the team were very responsive when we discovered the place had mistakenly not been cleaned before our arrival.  They offered to put us up in a hotel for the night, but we instead opted for a late night check-in to allow the cleaners to work their magic.  They instead offered to buy our dinner and a discount on our stay, which worked for us.  The patio & fire pit furniture had been moved into the garage due to a storm earlier in the week, so we missed out on enjoying them.  The house was conveniently located for our needs."
Delaware,2023-05-08,5,Airbnb,,Good
2834 N. Washington ,2023-10-08,5,Airbnb,,This airbnb made me feel as I was at home the house is everything and my stay was wonderful the host was very helpful and I would love to stay again in the future .
Gandy,2023-08-07,5,Airbnb,,Outstanding host! Very easy to work with!
Delaware,2022-10-23,5,Airbnb,,"Gabriel has a nice place and it’s as advertised. We set the thermostat at 70° and the upstairs got very hot overnight, so just a heads up. This place has plenty of towels which I really liked. Great stay, it was exactly what we needed"
Woodland,2023-03-26,5,Airbnb,,This spot was the perfect size for our family of 4 with two teenagers. Proximity to EVERYTHING was ideal.  Kudos for having sufficient blankets and pillows. Many Airbnb’s do not supply blankets and  it gets cold during the night. Access was super easy to get in and washer/dryer super helpful. Highly recommend this location!
4452 Carrollton,2023-07-30,5,Airbnb,,Responsive and kind host. The house had everything we needed for a comfortable stay!
2834 N. Washington ,2024-03-17,5,Airbnb,,Buen lugar para quedarse.
2836 N. Washington ,2024-10-14,5,Airbnb,,"We really enjoyed staying here during our first visit to Indianapolis. The home was close to restaurants and downtown Indy. It was quiet, clean and perfect for our family of 5. Host was readily available and replied to messages very quickly. We highly recommend staying here if you want something close to the city, but quiet and low key."
Woodland,2022-10-21,5,Airbnb,,"Great place! Stayed here for over one month while in Indiana for work. Very clean, new and looked after! Beds are super comfortable and the communication was awesome!"
30 Village Court,2023-11-08,1,Airbnb,,"Nothing  about this place was clean or easy. It has poor management and maintenance issues. No lightning whatsoever especially in the kitchen. We asked to have bulbs replaced, the place cleaned again after food was found and dirt in the couches and they barely touched it. My family broke out with a skin infection from the cleanliness and ended our stay when they said they would compensate and then failed to do so after I bought all new linens as one towel for 6 of us. The water heater went out and the heat. Was left scrambling to find another place, maybe ok for a weekend but not a good longterm solution."
Evanston ,2025-01-04,3,Vrbo,Very nice bungalow,This rental is in a great location and has recently been renovated.  It was clean and had good light in all rooms. The beds were so comfy.  The one issue we had was the washer and dryer were in the basement.  There was no mention of the basement in the VRBO description.  Would definitely stay again.  
1901 Carrollton ,2023-04-06,4,Airbnb,,"The location was very good, close to restaurants and shopping, and it was in a quiet and well-maintained residential neighborhood.  The house had plenty of space (there were only two of us so we only used the two back bedrooms),  with a pleasant living room and dining/kitchen area, and the beds were very comfortable.   I’m not sure what the listed price is now, but the house was well worth what we paid."
1620 Walden Court,2024-08-07,3,Airbnb,,"Ok<br/>The grounds maintenance makes the home very undesirable.  Weeds, untrimmed vegetation, tall grass and more.<br/>The biggest problem were the doors.  They do not open without serious force and the screen door is falling apart.  and sometimes the locks just didn't work.<br/>The shower curtains are dirty and the shower curtain repeatedly collapsed onto the floor <br/>Bathroom door is super squeaky<br/>The whole place was rather sad.  <br/>You can do better."
N. New Jersey ,2024-04-23,5,Vrbo,In Indy for the eclipse,"This is property is in the old Northside area of Indy, which is a very well-kept neighborhood of older homes. The property has been remodeled, the kitchen is very nice. It accommodated our group of five very well. It was a very convenient location, walking distance to some restaurants and minutes by car to downtown, the Children's museum and and the Zoo, all of which we visited. The only improvement I would suggest is to supply ice cube trays for the freezer, since there is no ice-maker. My crew likes ice in their drinks."
Southridge,2024-11-01,3,Airbnb,,Good and fine place
2836 N. Washington ,2023-12-22,5,Airbnb,,Brentwood was defiantly great! I will visit them again
Puntledge,2024-05-19,5,Airbnb,,It was centrally located to everywhere. Plenty of space for the 6 of us.
Grandview,2024-11-25,5,Airbnb,,"Home is located in a new up & coming area, with many new restaurants and stores in the area. Easy 45 minute drive to Lucas Oil stadium. The home was clean, open concept, and had everything we needed. We had 1 toddler, 2 babies, and 4 adults, we had more than enough space to hangout and enjoy everyone’s company without feeling crowded. <br/>The host was very welcoming and made everything easy for us! We will absolutely keep this place in mind for our next trip to Indy!"
Sanders,2023-03-20,5,Airbnb,,:)
1230 Union Street,2024-05-16,3,Airbnb,,"What a beautiful home!  It was perfect for a work trip. <br/>The neighbors have chickens and dogs in their yard which makes for a loud morning. Otherwise, Great location!"
Unit 262,2022-08-13,4,Airbnb,,Host was great.
Senour,2024-03-20,2,Airbnb,,"The listing states 11 guests maximum, but the living room and dining room only had seating for about 6.  The living room has one extremely uncomfortable couch and a futon.  The dining room table was very small, even thought the dining room was large enough for a much bigger table, and the chairs in there were also uncomfortable.  The fan in the bathroom was extremely noisy and connected to the same switch as the light.  We had to take the cover off and disconnect it manually to give my daughter a bath because she was afraid of the fan.  Plus, the bathroom door didn't latch and it swung open by itself, so no privacy in that bathroom.  Some of the rooms have blackout curtains that don't cover the entire window, thus defeating the purpose.  The outside trash was completely full and we ran out of trash bags, so at the end of our stay we had to leave some trash loose in the kitchen.  The basement was flooded, making the whole house musty.  I could go on..."
848 Camp St,2024-05-27,5,Airbnb,,The place was so incredibly clean that I actually think everything was new. We felt incredibly spoiled and lucky to be there. Lots of space. Lots of air conditioning. Very quiet. Adorable street. 10/10

2836 N. Washington ,2024-11-17,5,Vrbo,"Cute, Cozy and Comfortable!","I came to Indy with my family for a funeral. We drove 12 hrs from New York and couldn’t wait to get comfortable after such a long drive. When we finally arrived, we all bathed and melted into the bed. Because I have a toddler and infant, I was thankful for the washer and dryer. I really appreciated the breakfast bars and oatmeal for my vegetarian  daughter who did not eat our breakfast of eggs, bacon and toast purchased at a Whole Foods and cooked in the cute little kitchen. The neighborhood is safe and developing nicely. The Children’s Museum is also great for younger children among other historical sites. Thank you for a seamless visit. "
Sanders,2023-08-13,4,Airbnb,,Management very quick to respond to problems of which they were not aware. House needs a few small improvements to move it to the next level.
Sanders,2023-07-02,5,Airbnb,,"Great House with a great location! We had three mother & daughter families for a softball tournament- but was also close to the stadium and Race track! Neighborhood felt safe even though there are houses in need of repair. Major renovations throughout neighborhood! We went on several walks over our stay and always felt safe! House was clean and had everything we needed! We had two small issues (no fault of host) and they responded immediately. So pleased with the home, we would highly reccomend to anyone looking!"

848 Camp St,2025-04-24,3,Airbnb,,"Nice enough house and met our needs.  The neighborhood was fine and the free parking on the street worked.  Appreciated the coffee and the updates to the house seemed well done.  <br/>In their description, it notes that a registration process and rental agreement is required on a 3rd party site.  I had missed this.  Wifi also required a registration and a mandatory acceptance of promotions.  For me, these were annoyances that I wish I would have read more carefully.<br/>Good communication otherwise."

Grandview,2024-05-14,5,Airbnb,,"We stayed here for a ""girl's"" weekend with a group of mature women, who all traveled to Indianapolis from other cities/states/provinces. It was important for each of us to have our own bed, and the 6 beds in 4 bedrooms fit the requirement. The house was clean, and conducive to conversation and spending time together. We particularly enjoyed the backyard seating area. <br/>The location was convenient - it was near a local friend who's  milestone birthday we were celebrating. There were many nearby restaurants to choose from, as well as grocery and other stores for anything we might need.<br/>We also appreciated the laundry facilities and large kitchen. The host was proactive in checking in with us and made sure everything was going well."
5827 North College,2024-06-24,5,Airbnb,,"What an amazing home.  By far one of the best Airbnb's Ive stayed in. Great location in the MK area. Very quiet and felt like being at home. If you love to cook then this home is for you. The kitchen is amazing and Kathy has every item you will ever need plus a good amount of spices and oils to help get you started. Very clean and modern decor and well maintained.  I visit Indy 2-3 times a year and this is definitely at the top of my list to check for availability when visiting.  Very close to nightlife, markets, bars, and many great places to eat. Great parks nearby and downtown is about 15-20 minutes away.  Don't miss the opportunity to stay here if you get the chance."

We enjoyed our time in Indianapolis.

Primrose Ave,2024-10-23,3,Airbnb,,"Where to start, Brentwood’s place was something else. The biggest issue I had out of everything that happened to us during our short stay was that they charged for an early check-in, It was one fourth of the price of the night which was ridiculous to me and the hostess would not accommodate or cater to much of our needs. Brentwood was much better to work with and offered us credit when we had an issue. The beds are comfortable, and they had a desk that I was able to use for work for a little bit. The neighborhood was okay, and the offered snacks and coffee upon arrival."

Morris ,2025-03-09,4,Airbnb,,"We stayed in Indy to go to Supercross at Lucas Oil Stadium for the weekend. We Ubered a few times and it was a breeze for the Uber Drivers to find us place. We actually walked once from downtown back to the Airbnb and it wasn't a bad walk at all. The house was clean, spacious, had plenty of parking for our large group (7), and the host was very communicative. The house had all the necessary basic amenities that you need for a weekend stay. The neighborhood felt a little ""sketchy"", as there are a lot of homeless people  highly visible in the area. However, we didn't have any issues with anyone or anything. <br/>The only disturbance we ran into was the host's noise detectors located in the common area of the house. We traveled with a group of 7 and chose to  enjoy a night-in. The noise in our opinion was NOT excessive at all, but I got multiple texts telling me to keep the noise down. We apologized to the host but it definitely soured everyone's mood."
5827 North College,2020-09-07,5,Airbnb,,Great place to stay for a quick weekend getaway! Kathy has great hospitality and has a very nice home in the broad ripple area.
44 S Holmes,2024-06-30,3,Airbnb,,"Pros:<br/>1) Place smelled good and had all the essentials needed for a good stay. check in was straightforward<br/>2) host was very communicative and came by to quickly replenish clothes detergent when there wasn't any<br/>Cons:<br/>1) The train that runs nearby honks its horn for what feels like 100 times a day, continuing well into the night beyond 2 am. If you're a light sleeper or someone with little tolerance for noise, this place isn't for you. if it's not the train bothering you, it's the neighbor's rooster going off every 3 minutes. <br/>2) several cutleries and dishes were not properly cleaned. This was a surprise considering the hefty cleaning fee charged. <br/>3) Using the TV is troublesome due to connection issues, especially when using apps like Plex. <br/>4) most importantly, the host requires you to divulge personal information (like your home address) using their third party screening tool and will not refund your money if you don't agree, but also won't approve booking unless you do."

A supermarket is conveniently located just a few blocks away, and there is a soul-food restaurants within a block, serving delicious food, well-maintained, offering a pleasant atmosphere and a good social environment.<br/>However, I must mention that, apart from these positive aspects, there were a few issues with the bedroom. The furniture appeared to be of lower quality, the dressers were in poor condition, the twin futons in one of the bedrooms were uncomfortable. My face washcloths was clean but somewhat dingy, as if they had been used for cleaning other surfaces. These issues are not dealbreakers, and I would still highly recommend this place.""<br/>Best regards,<br/>PF"

Unit 262,2024-09-06,3,Airbnb,,"Pros; Responsive host. Excellent location for dining, shopping and highway access. Cons; Unit not well cleaned, Parking lot in bad shape, damaged both our cars. Host offered partial refund which felt insincere and more CYA for Airbnb policies. Unable to accept as alternatives were 3x the cost. Hosts then wished us luck getting further help from airbnb, which came across poorly. AC in kitchen so front of unit cold, bedrooms sweltering. Provided fans not helpful and several broken. Horrible wifi, cuts out constantly. Loud, inconsiderate neighbors. Smell of smoke(all kinds) throughout complex. Parking ""assigned"" but frequent issues so was directed to guest parking *2 spots* or ""park wherever."" Not recommended for extended stays(we were there a month,) families with young children, or single women. Neighbors seemed displeased its an Airbn and treat you accordingly. While several issues were out of hosts control it was important to note them for other travelers. Generally our worst stay."

I would say if you are looking at this location is go for the side of the home that ends in a 2 not the 0 address. The house has been well appointed. I kind of wish they had screens on the windows to keep windows open for a nice breeze through the house. The tile work was beautiful in the kitchen and bathrooms. nice backyard sitting area just remember you might get the odd rooster crow which is okay, the dogs well the is a different story. The location was real good we walked back from the game as Uber would have been insane. To get downtown to the restaurant and bars is about $12 USD. I recommend Tonys if you want to have a great meal. Kilroy's to watch games Sat and as a place to start on Sunday, Shapiros is a great walk for breakfast or Brunch.  Once the construction is over and well something can be done about the dog next door so remember ask for the unit that ends in 2 other than 0. once those are fixed it is a 5*"
30 Village Court,2023-03-05,5,Airbnb,,Gabriel’s location was great. Enough room inside and out. Was very clean. ( just couldn’t find the trash can for the kitchen 😊)<br/>He was very communicative. Loved the layout of the house.  <br/>I would definitely stay at one of his properties again

1901 Carrollton ,2023-10-08,4,Airbnb,,"Amazing host , communication was great , when the internet wasn’t working  they made sure to try and fix it and or accommodate her."
Higdon Ct.,2025-03-09,2,Airbnb,,The home was perfect for the size of my family. Everybody had some where to sleep comfortably. The house location was perfect close to everything that we came for. Everything was about 5-10 mins away even the airport. Which was perfect but the problem came in when my baby who is disabled had a crying spree being in a different environment than what he was use to. We were notified by the host that noise was detected and that the neighbors will complain. This home is not a connected to another one so I didn’t think the noise detector would go off for a child crying. Once I explained what was happening with the host I was told that it was sensitive and would alert for any noise. I was very shocked because I did not expect that to happen. So we moved past that and I received another alert for noise and this time all we was doing was singing happy birthday. I made the host aware of the reason we were there. I was just uncomfortable the rest of the time. The house was able to hold 11 people.
30 Village Court,2024-02-19,3,Airbnb,,First off the place was decent a little out dated smelled like old folks home. Upon check in I found a chip bag under my bed the master bath sink has slow drain the beds were rock hard made my back hurt they have HARD WATER! Don’t you dare play any music you’ll get harassed by the host to turn it down cause the whole place is bugged with noise devises/hidden cameras.  Also was accused of smoking in the house and I don’t even smoke been with Airbnb for 4 years never had them type of accusations on my account the host tells me she’ll be charging me 1k for a smoking fee I told her to send me proof  which she didn’t provide. I never smoked I asked her to meet me back at the Airbnb so I could check out what she was talking about she sent some guy to open the door saying it’s my word vs. there’s  upon walking in there was no smoke smell I’d be cautious of staying here they’ll find any and everything to harass you during your stay. And charge extra fees.
1232 Union Street,2023-07-30,5,Airbnb,,This space is super cute. Everything is brand new.  There was a small issue with the electricity going out and Brentwood was easy to communicate with and gave us a refund for the day we had to leave the premises.
N. New Jersey ,2023-07-24,5,Airbnb,,The house was great for our group of 7 adults:  spacious and clean.  Nice neighborhood and close to a lot of downtown restaurants.  Private house with parking and a yard.<br/>Host was responsive with a couple of questions but we didn't really need anything because the house had anything we needed.<br/>The house is close to the highway and traffic sounds can be heard in the evening/morning in a couple of the bedrooms.
Carson,2024-01-31,5,Airbnb,,"Great hosts, responded immediately to issues and resolved them quickly."
S. Madison St. ,2024-10-25,4,Airbnb,,"This cozy house is in a quiet residential neighborhood that is a short drive to the IU campus, shopping, and restaurants, and is easily accessible to the B-line. The kitchen and bathroom were updated and clean, and the linens and towels were new and high-quality. The washer and dryer are brand-new as well. The hosts were extremely responsive to questions and provided a nice guide to the local area. Check-in and check-out were easy. The windows, floors, and under the beds could use a thorough cleaning, and the kitchen necessities had not been restocked (e.g., dish soap, which made doing dishes difficult, especially in the absence of a dishwasher), but that can probably be chalked up to an off day for the cleaning crew. Overall, good value for a weekday stay."
5827 North College,2019-09-29,5,Airbnb,,"Kathy was a good host, she was very accommodating. I would recommend staying at her place and I would stay again when I visit my son at  UIndy."
2834 N. Washington ,2024-09-24,5,Vrbo,Work week,This was a great stay for the week beds were comfy great kitchen/living area watch your head as you go up the stairs though. Coffee area was great also. Messages to team were answered with good communication. Thanks for the stay.

Grandview,2024-01-13,4,Airbnb,,It was clean(there were some dust bunnies under the bed/s but that was it and there were plenty of supplies. The supplied coffee and tea(with  creamers and sugars) really helped it feel like we were on a little vacay instead of just being out of the house while the kitchen was redone. :)
1232 Union Street,2025-03-23,5,Airbnb,,"The home was clean, neigborhood was quiet and had everything we needed at the house. Great stay, highly reccomend."

Sanders,2024-09-24,5,Vrbo,Great location,"We stayed here to go to an NFL game, easy walk to the stadium.  We like to park the car and walk to our destination, it was an easy walk to bars and restaurants too.  Parking the car in the garage was a nice bonus."
5827 North College,2024-07-10,5,Airbnb,,"Beautiful brick house in historic register neighborhood. We loved staying here with our 2.5-year-old toddler and our dog. Safe and walkable neighborhood.

This home was big and beautiful private and peaceful. This home was very quiet clean and very homie.  Thank you to Brentwood for this wonderful stay.

4452 Carrollton,2023-07-21,5,Airbnb,,"My wife and I stayed here for two weeks this past summer. Absolutely loved the house, neighborhood, and city. The house is very relaxing -- they've done a great job at decorating. It was really easy to unplug as well; the only TV is in the basement. As such, we read a lot of books and did puzzles (which the host provided). Piano and guitar was nice as well for singing a few songs after dinner. Half a block away is root & bone, a great restaurant for lunch and dinner. You're also a few blocks from the Monon trail which we'd take walks on most mornings and evenings. Very great experience overall!"
1301 Ringgold,2024-08-04,5,Airbnb,,Very impressed with the location. Host was pleasant and responsive the whole stay.
1301 Ringgold,2024-10-13,5,Airbnb,,Lovely house in a great walking neighborhood with easy access to fun restaurants and cafes.
Mitchell St,2024-10-21,5,Vrbo,Fun sports weekend catching up with old friends,"The Bloomington Bliss property is aptly named, as my friends and I had a blast exploring this wonderful college town this past weekend. We've known each other for 30+ years, so on the rare occasions we can get together, we have a lot to catching up to do. This house provided the perfect venue. 

Communication with our host leading up to check-in and through our stay was very straightforward and always responsive. 

Though we mostly took ridesharing to campus, it would absolutely have been walkable. While it would  have been a bit more of a hike to the stadium, it's definitely doable. And despite the proximity to campus, we were treated to a family of deer peacefully enjoying their breakfast and dinner each day. 

Even with 6 grown men, we felt we had plenty of room both for socializing as well as for sleeping. We utilized each room at one time or another during our stay, as well as trying our hand at ping pong out on the screened in patio.

The beds were comfortable and the rooms were laid out in such a way that folks that were early-to-bed were not disrupted by the night owls. The kitchen offered us everything needed to cook daily breakfasts and even a few dinners during our stay.

Whether you are in town to attend an IU Football game or any other event on campus, I cannot recommend this place highly enough. We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if the opportunity arose."
1301 Ringgold,2024-07-28,5,Airbnb,,"My sorority sisters and I were in Indianapolis for a week and this was the perfect accommodations for 6 of us! The neighborhood seemed safe and quiet. The kitchen had everything we needed for meals. The snacks provided were a very nice and needed touch. The distance to restaurants, brewery, the convention center, etc was 10 minutes or less. We could have walked to get something to eat if we had wanted to. We were only able to enjoy the hot tub on the first night because of how busy we were but it felt fantastic after a long day of traveling. It would have fit us all, if we had utilized it. <br/>With 5 women, the bathroom space was perfect and we didn’t feel like we were crowded or on top of one another. The double shower in the master bedroom is incredible! <br/>This is definitely a prime place to stay at an affordable price. If we ever return this is where we will certainly book to stay!"
1123 Olive St.,2024-10-13,5,Airbnb,,We loved this spot!
College ,2023-05-14,5,Airbnb,,Wonderful space for family to gather when coming in from different cities.  Beautiful interior space just felt like home.  Each of us said we could easily see ourselves living there.  Questions after arrival were quickly answered by Gabe.  Definitely would stay there again if needed same type of accommodations.  Thanks Gabe !
Brentwood Property Group,2024-06-18,5,Google,,"I use Brentwood to manage my out of state mid-term rentals and would recommend Brentwood to anyone in the area. Gabe & his team go the extra mile to manage the entire process of finding tenants & screening tenants, managing turnover, providing updates, and helping find price effective solutions to inevitable capital and operating expenditures. Best of all, they are digitized and have invested in software to manage rentals so that you have transparency into accounting."
Southridge,2024-09-15,5,Vrbo,Great place to hang out,The house was exactly as described and we needed all of it. Great communication and we had everything we needed. Would definitely stay here again.
1301 Ringgold,2024-08-18,5,Airbnb,,Our group had a great stay! The house is super spacious and we really enjoyed using the hot tub!
Sanders,2024-06-21,5,Airbnb,,"We were in Indy for Olympic swimming trials and the place was super convenient to Lucas Oil Stadium.  local restaurants would have been walkable if not for the 90+ heat.  Parking was easy and the neighborhood was quiet.  There are a lot of trains going by, but the place was relatively soundproof."
1301 Ringgold,2024-04-05,5,Airbnb,,Beautiful home. Extremely walkable to great restaurants and bars around Fountain Square. Fully equipped kitchen and living spaces made this feel like a wonderful home away from home!
Fess Ave,2024-09-16,4,Vrbo,Visiting IU,A very nice stay
30 Village Court,2023-08-21,4,Airbnb,,House was very clean. Appliances were very good. Dining room lighting excellent. Furniture comfortable. All bedrooms upstairs. Stairs were a bit steep for senior citizens. Big closets. Walk in shower available in master bath. Tub/shower in hallway bathroom.  Washer & Dryer were great. Light/fan over kitchen table unable to control separately. Access to patio a bit unsafe.  No furniture on back deck. Back yard needed attention.  Living room and TV room are separate.  Would be good for a family.
44 S Holmes,2024-07-20,5,Airbnb,,Great house! <br/>Thanks for everything
444 Keystone,2024-11-03,5,Airbnb,,"Beautiful place, more spacious than expected, unbeatable price. Host was very quick to respond to any questions I had."
Senour,2024-05-12,5,Airbnb,,"The house was true to it's listing with enough space to fit us with our infant and 4 older kids. The house was easy to find and clean, good for cooking meals and relaxing but if we spent a larger portion of our day in the house we would have needed to find a way to entertain the kids as there were only a few board games/card games in the house as entertainment. Definitely not a deal breaker but important for families with young kids to know. All in all our stay was good."
Grandview,2024-12-30,5,Vrbo,Family Christmas gathering,We were three generations together to attend a larger family gathering.  The house is split plan. Main with king and queen on one side (share bath in main).  The other side is the bedrooms with two twins each and a shared hall bath between.  There is 1 towel and washcloth provided for each guest.  One pillow is available per guest with additional decorative pillows in the home.  We used decorative pillows under the fitted sheet to provide a safety bumper for the youngest family member so he wouldn’t roll out of the bed. The house was very clean and worked well for us.

Sanders,2024-07-21,5,Airbnb,,"Owners were fantastic and we truly appreciated all the extra touches that made our stay so much better. We were in town for a conference at Lucas Oil Stadium so we were really only here to sleep, which was perfect. The house had plenty of room for our family of 8. While the area is definitely in the midst of being revamped, it is still very urban and I’m not sure I would have been comfortable walking around or being outside with my children. I will say that any interactions we had with neighbors was pleasant and we had no issues with any of them."
Colere Place,2025-03-23,5,Airbnb,,"Enjoyed our stay - would easily stay here again. Great location, responsive hosts, very clean & beautiful home."
848 Camp St,2024-06-15,5,Airbnb,,"We were traveling as a band, with two big festivals to play in the region.  This place served as our ""HQ"" for two nights, and it was perfect.

Lake Ridge,2024-10-14,4,Vrbo,Great location at Eagle Pointe,"Communication with property manager for check in process was cumbersome. Apparently their CS reps are located outside the US. Communicate only via text or voicemail. When we had no access codes or address 20 hrs prior to check in, they had a horrible time understanding we were well within the 24 hr timeframe quoted. 
Property is well equipped but be advised very steep and narrow spiral stairs down the 2nd bedroom

Only blip was discovering a broken dial on dishwasher that made it inoperable. Ended up having to hand wash all dishes. "

341 Parkway,2024-10-16,5,Airbnb,,"Our home in Indiana unexpectedly needed major repairs that made it inhabitable. My husband, cat, and I were able to stay here last minute. The repairs at our house took longer than expected, and the host was gracious enough to let me add on another day to our stay. This was a safe haven for us, and we felt right at home. Very happy to have found this place!"
30 Village Court,2023-07-03,5,Airbnb,,"It was really clean, and location was great. Beds were comfortable. Host was very responsive! Only thing I was disappointed in was the towels weren’t all the way dry."

2836 N. Washington ,2023-03-28,5,Airbnb,,The house was absolutely spotless and beautiful. We were minutes from the Children’s Museum which was very convenient.

44 S Holmes,2024-05-12,5,Airbnb,,"I enjoyed the space. It was clean and comfortable. I liked the minimalist decor. However, I was deterred by the 10 am checkout and $35/hr charge to extend with the maximum check out time of 12 pm. Because of this, I wanted to mark down the rating to less than 5 stars. The day after my graduation, I  would have liked to rest a bit more before flying out. I recently stayed at the Hyatt where standard check out time was 12 pm. I had the option to extend til 1 pm with no charge. I could have easily booked at an Indianapolis hotel instead of this place. Otherwise, this was a pleasant stay."
44 S Holmes,2023-02-27,4,Airbnb,,"This house was nice on the inside, other than the lack of a dishwasher. The neighborhood is dangerous, with people coming and going all hours of the night. There is also a high homeless presence, making this not a good place to stay if you're with your kids or want to be out after dark."
330 E Caven,2024-12-15,5,Airbnb,,"This was a prefect place for us. In a quiet neighborhood, close to lucas oil stadium, and garage parking. We had one very minor issue with a door code not working for the garage, but they handled it extremely fast. I would without a doubt stay here again."

Unit 110,2022-11-16,4,Airbnb,,"The apartment matched the photos shown on the listing closely. As another reviewer mentioned, the walls and ceilings are thin so it was quite noisy most hours of the day/night, but it was bearable. Overall, though, the stay was good for a few days and close to everywhere we needed to go."
2836 N. Washington ,2024-08-04,5,Airbnb,,"Brentwood's listing looked like the photos.  That was nice.  The entire home was clean for our arrival.  There were plenty of towels, kitchen ware, soaps, etc., for our stay.  The only hiccup was the code to get into the home and that was thanks to technology.  Brentwood was very quick to respond with a new code for us.  We would definitely stay here again and recommend this home to others."

We walked to Lucas Oil stadium and stopped along the way for dinner. We had good weather and that helped. Rode scooters home and walked a bit. No ubers in sight after Taylor Swift concert. The apt was clean and the coffee and creamer was a big plus. Tons of room for blow up mattress and was comfortable for my daughter. Thanks!"

6115 Ralston,2024-08-21,5,Airbnb,,"We had a good stay… Home is small and super cute and the location is fabulous.  It felt safe and walkable, was close to the dog park, and so many great places to eat and shop.  The only disappointment was that the mattresses in both bedrooms were very very soft and saggy like hammocks, and we like Firm mattresses for comfort and for our back, so we slept poorly, which was a pretty big deal as we were there for three weeks. :("
1230 Union Street,2024-03-01,3,Airbnb,,"The house is pretty enough, but not in the best location. We had several issues with the rental throughout the week. First of all, they list one more bed than they actually have. they don't have 2 pull out sofa beds, just an uncomfortable couch and a cheap futon. Not enough towels, blankets, or pillows for the number of people we had in the reservation, either. <br/>Then comes the more serious issues. The fire alarm battery started to die and it beeped every 60 seconds or so. When we asked for a replacement battery, they told us those are locked up and that we should just deal with the beeping because their staff was already home at 6:30 and they didn't want to deal with it. Lastly, the door on the master bedroom patio doesn't latch or even really close properly, so when it storms or the neighbor's dog barks all night (which both happened), you hear everything. <br/>Not a huge fan of this place. It was cheap and we got what we paid for"
2836 N. Washington ,2024-11-03,5,Airbnb,,Our stay was great! They knew we were in Indianapolis for the Taylor Swift concert and left us a cute little welcome bag with bracelets and Taylor Swift goodies. Very personable and accommodating.
2834 N. Washington ,2024-08-04,5,Airbnb,,We went for Gen Con. At first the code didn’t work and we had to call to get a different code. That was remedied easy enough. The place was the cleanest AirBNB I have been to. It was a quiet neighborhood as well. <br/>Overall it was a nice stay.
1230 Union Street,2024-07-22,5,Vrbo,Outstanding Accommodations,"This property near downtown is first-class. From the upstairs bedrooms, bathrooms, first floor kitchen to the basement - all top-of-the-line materials used for all upgrades and renovations - from appliances to floors.

I wish check out was a bit later. The nonrefundable 35$ or 500$ hold for 14 days , just doesn’t balance out to me. But I understand not everyone is civil and accidents happen. Overall I’d stay again."

1620 Walden Court,2023-05-14,4,Airbnb,,"Very nice home and would stay here again. I gave it 4 stars because there were a couple of small issues: 1. Dishwasher was full and clean. We had to unload when we arrived. 2. Only 4 coffee cups in the house 3. Landscaping around the house needs attention 4. Ran out of hot water after 2 showers (there were 5 adults staying here). The last 3 to get ready were not too happy. 5. One of the mattresses is sunken in the middle, causing both occupants to roll to the middle.

Pleasant ,2024-08-05,5,Airbnb,,"The house matched the photos to a T, and still managed to blow us away beyond expectations.

Carson,2024-04-17,5,Vrbo,A great home-away-from-home stay complete with our cats!,"Well, two of them. The other five were happily at home, a mile away from us.

My spouse and I live (very) locally, but had a friend coming into town and we didn't want to make him spend a week in the chaos of our mid-renovations house. Luckily I spotted this property, incredibly near to home, and with everything we needed to sleep, work, watch K-Dramas on Netflix, play Scrabble, skritch cats and generally have a great time.

The manager was friendly and more than helpful, the online user guide for the property was great for our trio of nerds. We had no problems with check-in/out, electronics, internet, appliances, furniture, or anything else.

The house, furniture, and bedding were clean, comfortable, climate-controlled, and equipped with an electronic lock and Ring for extra comfort on the peace-of-mind level. (Not that the neighborhood is unsafe; I live there. It's pleasant, quiet, and close to a variety of food, shopping and entertainment options.)

I'd stay here again, if I didn't live just down the street!"

One of the bedroom door didn’t close all the way it was crack open which for my 8 year old she was scared otherwise I would’ve been fine. The shower curtain had black stains on it poor cleaning. The downstairs TV  didn’t  wasn’t connecting to the server . The host did reached out and I let him know, he asked what can they do to make it right, I was only there briefly too busy to figure out, but it would’ve been a 5 star if it wasn’t for these issues hope they are fixed for the next host."

341 Parkway,2023-10-23,5,Airbnb,,"The house was as advertised, beautiful interior. Amazing back yard space, with the attached two car garage with an easy transition into the home. As mentioned the stairs are steep so be careful. Host was very responsive and allowed us to check in early. <br/>We were in Indy for the game and were able to walk to the stadium, it was a 25 minute walk to the stadium. This will be our go to home when we come for games going forward."
Sanders,2023-06-14,5,Airbnb,,"Great place, great communication with host."
5827 North College,2019-12-14,5,Airbnb,,"This place is so stylish and the hospitality was wonderful! The dog was so sweet, and the house was vintage yet so chic! We would definitely recommend this space! It's also close to some really awesome local wonders!"
44 S Holmes,2024-01-13,4,Airbnb,,Our stay was fine. The neighborhood is not dangerous but it’s not pretty either. The listing originally included a dishwasher but there wasn’t one which was problematic for us given that we have a newborn.  Communications with the host were mostly quick and easy. I think this listing is ideal for shorter stays.
4452 Carrollton,2025-03-06,5,Airbnb,,The house was cute and cozy and check in was super easy. Owners were also super quick to respond. One small thing was that the floors in the dining room are a little creaky. But overall great and we enjoyed our stay!
2836 N. Washington ,2023-11-21,5,Vrbo,Beautiful and plenty of room,Lovely getaway for my sisters and I. There was a little confusion about an extra fee that we had to pay before we could check in. Otherwise a perfect place near the center of town!
Brentwood Property Group,2024-12-10,10,Internal,,5 stars!! Will be back!

Southridge,2024-11-11,5,Airbnb,,My group stayed in this property for over a week and it was a great part of our trip to the area! The space was clean and everything was as described. The host was very responsive. Would highly recommend this property to others.
1123 Olive St.,2025-04-06,5,Airbnb,,"We had such a wonderful stay! The home was immaculately clean and had plenty of space for our family, my husband’s parents, and my own. We especially appreciated the spacious garage that fit all three of our cars—a super convenient feature!<br/>The beds were very comfortable and we loved cozying up by the fireplace in the family room during the evenings. The house had everything we needed and the hosts were exceptionally communicative.<br/>Our little one absolutely loved the area in the basement that is being set up for an arcade—the comfy chairs and open space made it perfect for play and relaxing.<br/>The only downside was the weather—lots of rain and storms during our stay—but being in such a comfortable and welcoming home made even the gloomy days enjoyable!<br/>We would absolutely stay here again. Thank you for a great experience!"
Primrose Ave,2024-09-29,5,Airbnb,,There was not a hairdryer in the house like the listing stated. I contacted the host and they delivered a new one straight away. They are very responsive!
Colere Place,2025-02-23,5,Airbnb,,Great Bnb i loved it
330 E Caven,2024-06-13,5,Vrbo,Exceeded expectations,"The property management was very communicative. I was pleasantly surprised by the amenities, provided coffee, oatmeal, some washer pods, etc. We will definitely consider staying here again when we are back."
1901 Carrollton ,2023-04-15,5,Airbnb,,Nice place to stay. No issues with the home or host. Would recommend it as a nice location and would stay again.
4452 Carrollton,2023-06-20,5,Airbnb,,"This house is extremely well appointed, supplied with amenities that you would see in a nice hotel.<br/>Fun area with great restaurants, pubs and walking trail."
44 S Holmes,2023-02-05,4,Airbnb,,"Gabriel’s place was absolutely AMAZING. The outside is beautiful & so is the inside. Very clean & well stocked. The living room & dining room was exactly what me & my sisters needed. I came to Indy to celebrate with my sister for her birthday. Everything was just as pictured. The bedrooms were nice and the beds were comfy. The larger bedroom had a really firm memory mattress. The upstairs bathroom was well stocked, clean and beautiful. The half bathroom & let out sofa was great downstairs because one of my sisters can’t climb stairs due to an accident.<br/>The kitchen was beautiful & well stocked. <br/>I cooked all my sisters a beautiful birthday dinner.  <br/>Upon entering We had a small issue with the lock because it was extremely cold this day however Gabe showed up in a few minutes & everything was fine. <br/>I will definitely book with Gabe again if I’m in the Indy area. <br/>Thanks Gabe for providing a great place for me & my family."
1620 Walden Court,2023-05-22,4,Airbnb,,Kind host
6115 Ralston,2024-04-10,5,Vrbo,Review,Perfect spot for us and our pups. We enjoyed our stay.
1230 Union Street,2023-08-06,5,Airbnb,,This might be the best property I’ve stayed at through Airbnb. Stunning interior with gorgeous finishes and extra touches. The pictures do not do this home justice. I would highly recommend it and will stay here again the next time I’m in Indianapolis.
Delaware,2023-07-30,5,Airbnb,,Quick to respond. Close to the children’s museum
1230 Union Street,2025-04-24,5,Airbnb,,They were extremely responsive to our communication!
848 Camp St,2024-10-20,5,Airbnb,,"Had an excellent stay.  I particularly enjoyed the very well stocked kitchen.  Everything we needed to cook a meal was available to us.  Very clean home and great for our group of 5 adults.  Great location, very walkable."
848 Camp St,2025-01-01,5,Airbnb,,We booked a last minute trip and were lucky enough to find this listing. The house was in a great location to check out Indianapolis and surrounding areas. It had everything we needed to be comfortable. The snacks left in the kitchen were a nice touch I didn't realize I needed. Thanks!
5827 North College,2025-02-03,5,Airbnb,,We stayed a few months over the holidays. It’s a great location for getting around Indy without having to deal with the highways and interstates. The home is stocked well and thoughtfully. Very dog friendly. We were comfortable from the moment we arrived. Thanks!
Fess Ave,2024-04-09,5,Airbnb,,"After a place we had booked for a year cancelled on us last minute, we were scrambling to find an alternate accommodation to view the 2024 Solar Eclipse and this little gem was the perfect place.  It was a brand new listing with no reviews, but the owner/manager was listed as a Superhost and the place was exactly as described.  Also, Brentwood was so accommodating of our last minute plans.  There was a huge park right at the end of the street, with a walking path that connects to the street, so if you have kids that want to get outside and play or you’re someone who likes a walk/jog in the morning, this is a perfect location!!  If we find ourselves back in Bloomington, we will definitely stay here again!!"
Grandview,2024-06-30,5,Airbnb,,Great home base for lacrosse tournament.
Sanders,2024-04-09,5,Vrbo,Eclipse 2024,This location is great! We loved the house and the back yard. The garage was an added bonus! Would reccomend this for a great place to stay while in Indy!! The only negative was the freight train blowing the horn in the middle of the night. Everybody slept through it after we heard it the first night and knew it would happen.
Delaware,2022-11-01,5,Airbnb,,This was a great place to stay.  The host was responsive and supportive.
2836 N. Washington ,2025-03-10,4,Airbnb,,"We had a great experience with our host.  The listing was accurate, interior was very clean, and the beds were nice!   Kitchen is a great setup as well.   <br/>We had some issues with very loud neighbors (unfortunately our party was here for a sporting event and looking forward to a full night rest, and we didnt' get to sleep until 3 AM because of the all-night noise).   HOWever, I believe this was another booking next door, not full-time neighbors - and Gage was a great communicator and eager to help us resolve the issue."
4452 Carrollton,2023-05-27,5,Airbnb,,"Great communication. Clean and quaint bungalow home with all the amenities. It’s located in a nice, quiet neighborhood within walking distance to some local restaurants on College Ave and the Monon.  This place is as advertised."
330 E Caven,2024-04-07,5,Airbnb,,"Great place, will return!"
Morris ,2023-12-03,5,Airbnb,,"Great place, would stay again."
Woodland,2025-04-13,5,Airbnb,,We went down to Indy for my daughter’s 7th birthday. This home worked great. The hosts were very responsive. Local stores very close by which worked out. 🙂
Senour,2023-12-28,3,Airbnb,,"Cheap furniture and not well maintained. Some doors didn't shut, some didn't latch like the bathroom. Beds we're cheap and not very comfortable. Not much to do there either. Fine for a place to sleep but nothing special."
N. New Jersey ,2023-01-08,5,Airbnb,,"The house worked out perfectly for friends visiting from out of town. Easy to check in, lots of space and very close to downtown. Hope to be able to book in again in the future!"
Senour,2024-07-03,5,Airbnb,,"What a lovely and comfortable home. Each room had it's own vibe and felt so cozy. It was the perfect place for a girl's sleepover - there were even a few board games onsite. The property website was a great touch with all sorts of good info that we found so helpful. Also, the check-out was the easiest I've ever experienced!  This home sits back off a quiet street, in a lush, pretty neighborhood and you'll get a peaceful night's rest for sure. The hosts were very communicative and we felt cared for & thought of.  We couldn't locate an iron (we also didn't ask - I'm sure we would have gotten a quick response but we were focused on getting to the airport)."
2834 N. Washington ,2023-10-22,5,Airbnb,,Very clean and very helpful hosts. The home was exactly as listed
30 Village Court,2024-01-04,5,Airbnb,,"Very nice home in a nice section of Zionsville. Host is accommodating, responsive and there were no issues."
135 Hillcrest ,2023-10-15,5,Airbnb,,Everything was great; would definitely stay again!
Woodland,2024-12-14,5,Airbnb,,Very easy to work with. Would stay there again.
Pleasant ,2024-06-23,5,Airbnb,,"The home was beautiful and perfect for our visit to Lucas Oil Stadium. Adults loved the rooftop and kids loved the basement area and arcade games. <br/>Some of the surrounding area looked a bit unsafe so having a garage was clutch for safety as well as considering how tight parking was on the street. The kitchen lacked casserole dishes and dish towels, but everything else about our stay was top notch. <br/>The owners were responsive and a pleasure to work with. Would definitely go again!"
Woodland,2024-08-05,5,Airbnb,,"This is a cute little<br/>House in an older neighborhood. It is close to Ruoff Music Center which was why we were there. getting an Uber was easy. Shopping and restaurants were close. There were a few things that we thought would have been nice but weren’t that big of a deal. Also, the living space is not that comfortable if you are looking to hang out. But the place was clean and the beds were comfortable. Would stay again."
44 S Holmes,2023-07-10,5,Airbnb,,"Brentwood’s listing was EXCEPTIONALLY clean and we felt right at home! All necessities were available. Back yard parking was convenient. I will say the neighborhood was not great, however we felt safe and it was minutes from downtown with lots of restaurants, Victory Field, the Zoo, and more. The neighbors had roosters that were noisy outside, but it didn’t affect our sleep/stay any. We would stay here again! I was really impressed with how clean it was."
325 N. Bancroft,2025-01-21,4,Airbnb,,Pretty nice little place with plenty of room. All in all it was a nice place though especially for the price.
6115 Ralston,2024-07-28,4,Airbnb,,"We enjoyed the beds, very comfortable. The fenced in backyard worked well for our puppy."
4452 Carrollton,2023-07-04,5,Airbnb,,"The bungalow provided all the necessities and then some! The location was convenient to downtown and was with in walking distance to several breweries. The piano and guitar were fun additions, as were the provided games and puzzles. The fenced in backyard was also a great space."
Pleasant ,2024-09-08,5,Airbnb,,Very responsive rental team. The home itself was just as pictured and parking was great. Would definitely recommend renting with the Brentwood group.
4452 Carrollton,2024-09-07,5,Airbnb,,"Great place to stay! Clean, bright, and nice yard for my dog. Easy check in, too. My only complaint and it’s barely worth mentioning, honestly, is that there are no curtains on the living room windows. It would have felt safer to close curtains at night."
1529 Linden,2025-02-02,5,Airbnb,,"Beautiful cozy home, easy to get to and great host"
30 Village Court,2023-12-27,2,Airbnb,,todo estuvo muy bien excelente solo algo malo que no me gusto que estuve recibiendo cantidad de mensajes durante mi cena navideña y mis invitados ya no pudieron estar contentos y con la confianza pues los mensajes decían que hacíamos demasiado escándalo y que estábamos molestando a todos los vecinos creo que no fue así ya que de ver sido asi alguna autoridad del orden hubiera llegado a la propiedad eso realmente fue lo que no me gustó. de lo demás la propiedad fue muy buena la experiencia gracias......
Grandview,2024-09-22,5,Vrbo,Good Location,The property was close to many options for restaurants and parks but also in a quiet neighborhood.  Could be helpful to have a few more utensils for cooking and some smaller sized spoons.  Thanks for sharing your property with us.
44 S Holmes,2025-01-20,5,Airbnb,,What an amazing home that’s super spotless and clean . I can’t forget how cozy and welcoming the home felt . The host was very professional and helpful .  I recommend others stay .
30 Village Court,2023-12-03,4,Airbnb,,"Thanks for a nice stay. We were visiting for a wedding and the family lives very near the location. Responsive to my questions. All was in shape and as advertised. Many thanks, <br/>Joseph"
Pleasant ,2024-07-28,5,Airbnb,,"Really nice, spacious house for a group! In an awesome neighborhood. Super walkable and close to restaurants, coffee, bars, shopping, etc."

1230 Union Street,2024-06-13,5,Vrbo,"Nice, clean place","The place was very clean and well appointed. We were here for a convention, so not at the house that much, but it had everything we needed."
Sanders,2024-11-22,5,Vrbo,Great stay,We enjoyed are stay. Everything went smooth once we arrived.
Sanders,2024-11-03,5,Vrbo,Excellent place for our visit,"House was exceptionally clean, beds were very comfortable, and location close to downtown Indy very good.
Owner communicated quickly.
Would definitely stay here again"
4452 Carrollton,2023-05-29,5,Airbnb,,"This is a great place to stay. Perfect size for 3 people. Conveniently located near downtown (and walkable to a couple of nearby restaurants), well-appointed, and unbelievably clean. Would stay again!"
Carson,2024-05-05,3,Airbnb,,"Unfortunately neighbors used our porch numerous times & very very loud/obnoxious neighbors, windows and back door was locked= definitely potential fire safety issue, the beds were very uncomfortable and several outlets in the kitchen area were not functioning. Additionally due to the amount of trash in the yard I had to clean up other neighbors trash/dog poop so that I wasn't accused of being the one to leave it there. Grass was also very tall like past my shin which made it challenging for my 1 yr old grandson and my dogs to walk in the yard at all. many of the dishes and silverware in the drawers were still dirty so we just used plastic ware and paper plates. the quality of the experience definitely didn't match the fees and deposits I had to pay for my family members & furbabies. My daughter in law found cat food upstairs as well so it was definitely strange being that the owners stated in their agreement absolutely no cats."
Grandview,2024-04-15,5,Airbnb,,"Our family of 7 enjoyed our 4-night stay in this house.  The house has everythiing you need for up to 8 people, including coffee, shampoo, conditioner, etc. Plus a ping pong table, foosball and great backyard. This house is in a really good location!  The host was incredibly organized and responsive. We needed a bathtub drain plug and maintenance brought one over within an hour.  We highly recommend this house!"
1620 Walden Court,2023-08-06,1,Airbnb,,"This place looks fine on the inside with the pictures. Outside photos should have tipped me off. Run down for sure but the lack of cleanliness is a show stopper. Not a good experience. Management company was extremely responsive and asked to make things right.  We didn’t want cleaners coming in with all of our belongings. The place was dirty, we couldn’t get Wi-Fi to connect to any of our devices. Bare bones, one towel for each of four guests but there was room for 7 people. We’re golfers and runners so took a couple showers per day. One towel looked like it had blood stain. Not a clean place and way too expensive. After cleaning fees ( is it ever cleaned?), fees and taxes we most certainly would have been better off in a hotel. Don’t let Zionsville  location fool you.  Management company said they’d provide a partial refund but have not seen it yet."
6140 Winthrop ,2024-06-22,5,Airbnb,,"Easy walk to coffee/drinks/food. Great front porch, plenty of space for our family to relax at the end of busy days. Quick walk to bus line. Very cute neighborhood"
4452 Carrollton,2024-08-26,5,Airbnb,,Perfect location when visiting Butler University.
4452 Carrollton,2024-08-11,5,Airbnb,,"The bungalow was a very cute and cozy place for my husband and I and our two dogs! Great amenities, plenty of space, and the backyard was wonderful and secure! We were able to walk to a few delicious restaurants and coffee shops. The host was very responsive when we had trouble with the keypad and quickly solved the issue. <br/>We did arrive home one night to find that a large limb had been moved, making us a little nervous that “someone has been here” until we realized the following day that it was the lawn service. We were not notified that someone would be coming to cut the grass during our stay. <br/>We would absolutely stay again!"
Unit 110,2022-12-04,5,Airbnb,,"Loved Gabriel’s place! The apartment is very clean, well-furnished, and cute. The bed was also very comfortable. Check in was a breeze and Gabriel was clear and friendly in his communications. The only negative is you can hear the people upstairs walking around quite clearly. I’m used to that so it didn’t bother me much but it seems like something others might appreciate a heads up on. Throw in some earplugs when you go to bed and you’re set! Also wouldn’t mind some curtains on the bedroom window just for added privacy. Back to the positives… It’s a relatively straight shot to downtown, close to the airport, and easy to get to from the expressway, so the location was great. Overall, a super comfortable and convenient place to crash! Would 100% stay here again if I came back to Indy."
30 Village Court,2023-10-15,4,Airbnb,,"Very solid place, lots of room, easily slept our party of 7. Checking in was super easy, liked the electronic keypad on the door so we didn't have to deal with keys. Only criticism is it feels like a few simple things were overlooked, like not having hooks to hang towels in the master bath, or the hair catch in the shower not being emptied."
N. New Jersey ,2023-07-02,5,Airbnb,,We loved our stay! The beds are very comfortable. It has a great layout and is exceptionally clean. The neighborhood is safe charming. There is some highway noise but we really liked the neighborhood and location. Very easy to get to all the major attractions in Indianapolis.
Primrose Ave,2025-04-13,5,Airbnb,,"This is our second time staying at Brentwood's listing. The beds are unbeatable. Our family has never slept so good both times we have stayed here. It has a very convenient location for our planned activities during our stay. The house is very kept together and very clean. The only thing that did not work this time during our stay was the outdoor lights did not work, which is one of the reason we love to stay here. Not a big deal at all and we did not contact the host about such a minor issue. Anytime we contacted the host, they responded immediately and answered any and all questions that we had. I would highly recommend this beautiful house is you are staying in the area and we will definitely be staying again if we are in the area!"
10th St,2025-03-09,5,Airbnb,,"Nice place, clean and no issues. Would stay again"
Grandview,2024-03-15,5,Airbnb,,The crew enjoyed their extended stay....
Gandy,2024-12-15,4,Airbnb,,"Super clean place to stay. Not an amazing street to stay on but never felt unsafe. Just no street lights or anything. But once inside, super cozy. We only needed a place to crash so it worked for us. Also, the ceiling light/fan in the living kept turning on, on its own and there was no way to stop it. That honestly is the only reason I took one star away. Also, wouldn’t hurt to leave a few coffee packs in the kitchen for the coffee maker :)"
Unit 262,2022-06-26,5,Airbnb,,"We had a nice short stay, Gabriel was easy to get in touch with and great at communicating with me when needed, the apartment look as nice in person as it did in the pictures"
Grandview,2025-01-24,5,Airbnb,,"Great home, thanks for letting us enjoy your space!"
Southridge,2024-10-01,5,Airbnb,,Spent a week at this home and enjoyed it immensely.
1230 Union Street,2024-06-23,4,Airbnb,,"The home itself was great for what we needed.  Close to Lucas Oil and downtown Indy.  We walked most days.  The interior is great and has everything you need.  Some more/better couches would be a great addition, but it was sufficient for the 4 of us.  The neighborhood however has a lot to be desired - old southside.  It isn't the cleanest, and it seems like it is in a state of revival.  Everything seemed safe, just not the cleanest.  The biggest issue with this home is the neighbors.  Very noisy and dogs barking constantly - even at 2am, plus a rooster crowing at 5am every day."
2836 N. Washington ,2023-04-16,5,Airbnb,,"It was definitely a 5 star stay and we had a situation where the hosts demonstrated that they were responsive and ready to assist with any issues.  The one thing I would say to future guests is be careful with the high tech locks on the door, they come with a very secure and long code that you can't memorize and the door automatically locks immediately behind you whenever its closed.  If you put those two things together it is extremely easy to get locked out while going back and forth for example to take out the trash or grab something from your car.  If you don't have your phone on you to retrieve the long password while quickly running in and out you will find yourself as I did, locked out, or as my neighbor on the other side did standing in the rain while he dug out the password after just running out to grab something.  They should either shorten the password to something you can potentially remember for quick access, OR share a way to turn off the auto-lock feature."
Colere Place,2025-01-12,5,Airbnb,,Beautiful place to stay and the host was very responsive when i had questions!!!  Great location!! Within minutes of restaurants and stores of all kinds! Would recommend this place to anyone! Absolutely loved our stay!!!
4452 Carrollton,2024-04-05,4,Airbnb,,"The Brentwood Team was very helpful and quick to respond when we had an issue. The house was nice. It seemed their cleaner hadn't gotten through the whole house, and there were a few supplies that were low (garbage bags, body wash in the shower), but overall it was a good stay."

10th St,2025-03-15,5,Airbnb,,Thank you so much for renting to us.   The place was excellent as well as the location.   Will definitely reach in the future while visiting Indy.
Sanders,2023-11-26,5,Airbnb,,"We had an awesome time. We kept renewing our stay because we didnt want to leave. What was supposed to be a 3 day stay, turned into a 5 day stay. The <br/>House was amazing and clean, exactly like the photos, the hosts were great and responsive. <br/>I will definitely make this my go to house on air b n b. We actually live pretty close, but decided to rent an air b n b for the holidays so we can be together under 1 roof. <br/>Brentwood made our Thanksgiving the best in years!!!!!"
Southridge,2024-12-31,3,Vrbo,Too many safety concerns,"Inside the front door, there is a single step down  that is hard to see because the colors are shades of brown and the step is not marked. The ""Step Down"" warning sign on the outside of the front door seems to refer to the unusual step down on the *outside* of the front door frame. *None* of us noticed the badly faded ""after you enter"" handwritten words on the sign until after one of us fell and badly twisted an ankle that required medical attention.  There are two even harder to see single steps on the wooden deck that are completely unmatked and are also tripping hazards. There is no bathmat in the tub with the shower. And, while the door code deadbolt works perfectly, the latch on the ordinary doorknob does not engage and, thus, does not hold the door shut when the wind blows.  The house was adequate for our stay, but the lack of adequate attention to safety is disheartening."
Southridge,2024-07-07,5,Airbnb,,"This was a lovely home ,  it is not handicap friendly but the host accomadated our needs. He was quick to respond. <br/>The decor is cute the house is cozy could use a little more kitchen supplies, but he had most of what we needed. <br/>The location was great we were there for softball at grand park. great choices of restaurants all within 10 min of house. I would stay again"
2834 N. Washington ,2024-03-20,4,Airbnb,,The place was very nice and the beds were comfortable. There were some dirty silverware in the dishwasher when we arrived and towels in the dryer. It was in a great location with short commutes to restaurants and the children’s museum.

4452 Carrollton,2023-08-14,5,Airbnb,,"we loved our stay here.  the house is first and foremost in a fantastic location:  walkable, easily accessible, in just a beautiful neighborhood.  the home itself was definitely cozy.  i loved the spacious porch.  the den area in the basement was great, especially with the newly-renovated full bathroom.  we had plenty of space (just the two of us), but the house is roomy enough for families, too.  the kitchen is recently updated and very functional.  my only complaint would be the lack of basic supplies for the home.  we were staying for an entire week, and were provided a single trash bag.  we had to buy multiple tissue boxes, as well.  just ensure you grab some extra trash bags and the like before you arrive.  otherwise, just a lovely stay.  thank you."
Pleasant ,2024-09-29,4,Airbnb,,"This is a beautiful house. It was spacious enough for 10 people to stay in without us tripping over each other. The kitchen was beautiful. The hosts are incredibly punctual with returning any messages or questions. <br/>My only real concern is that the listing and photos were a tad misleading. We were expecting five bedrooms; while there were enough beds, one of the “rooms” was more like a closet of another. The sliding door that connected them did little to nothing in terms of privacy between the two. <br/>Overall, this was a good experience. I would recommend staying here if you have a large group of people."

Evanston ,2023-11-25,3,Airbnb,,"With a couple of minor adjustments, this could be a great place to stay with a dog. There were burrs in the backyard, so we realized quickly we were unable to use the back yard for the dog. There were no coffee filters for the carafe coffee maker, although there were plenty of pods for the keurig-style coffee maker. Some extra blankets for the bed in the 2nd bedroom would have been helpful. Overall, though, it's a good value for a home that allows a dog."

10th St,2023-07-23,5,Airbnb,,"Brentwood is the perfect place to stay for a couple or a small family<br/> it has everything you need. The place was clean and the response time was timely. This was definitely enough space! It is like a 6 minute walk from the Bottleworks community which has excellent food options! The Garage has countless food options to satisfy any appetite. The Fountain offers a fine dining experience while they have a small family owned place called Love Handle for breakfast. The Bottleworks district offers a place where bikes and or scooters can be rented and there are nearby trails. There is a copy shop 1 min away from property. Be mindful that this is a carriage house so you have to carry luggage up the stairs. They have a high chair for a baby and a pack and play. They even had snacks on the counter for us! The desk was an added bonus! There is an air mattress and the couch converts to a bed as well! It was a great stay and only 2 miles from the Covention Center/stadiums. Nice, safe, Quiet stay!"
1301 Ringgold,2024-11-02,5,Airbnb,,"Gorgeous! The pictures do not do this place justice! We only stayed one night for a concert (we were greeted with a Taylor Swift themed welcome back with decorations, temporary tattoos, friendship bracelets, and delicious cookies!) but wished we would have booked another night!

The location was perfect with lots of restaurants and things to do.  Communication was top notch.  Thank you for a lovely stay!
2834 N. Washington ,2023-08-06,3,Airbnb,,"The reason for the low overall rating was that there was no toilet tissue, paper towels, extra towels or blankets. We were to purchase our own toilet paper and paper towels,  and we'd be reimbursed. Well that's not helpful when you NEED those items right away. <br/>The sofa is listed as an extra sleeping area, but there were no blankets or pillows for it. <br/>The upstairs bathroom had trash still in the can and the downstairs one was visibly not well cleaned. <br/>The location was good and convenient. The majority of the amenities were provided, but lacking so many necessities was unacceptable."

As a Short Term Rental owner, I needed someone who is highly dedicated and pays attention to every detail for optimal customer satisfaction, and Gabe was the absolute best person for that. As a new STR owner, I also needed some education and he was really good at that too. He is a very patient and courteous property manager and jumps into any maintenance issues right away. Gabe and Brentwood Property also provide STR setup / furnishing services and they do a great job at that too, saving the owners a lot of time and resources. Highly recommend!"

There were three of us and it felt absolutely indulgent to each have our own delightful bedroom and full bath.  Everything was well stocked and clean and ready for us to settle in for hot tub time, games, coloring and laughter.  The kitchen is great for cooking and the dining areas are set for eating around the table or hanging on the barstools.  It was a cold weekend, so we didn't walk around, but the area is completely walkable and we even discussed re-booking in warmer weather so we can do so.

The kitchen is great, and the living areas downstairs were all open and inviting. We were within walking distance to many of the places we wanted to see, and a quick Uber ride if we didn't feel like walking or driving. There was a lot of construction going on on 70, which is right next to the house, but that'snothing that can be controlled by Gabe. We have already talked aboutcoming back this summer for a weekend getaway!"
Sanders,2024-08-19,5,Airbnb,,"We had a fantastic girls weekend in Indianapolis.  The location was just a short Uber ride to downtown shops, restaurants and Gainbridge Fieldhouse (Go Fever!).  The house was very tastefully decorated and the beds were very comfortable. It was very easy to get into the house and checkout instructions were clear and easy. We didn’t spend a lot of time in the house other than sleeping and showering. We only used the kitchen to make coffee and tea in the mornings. The extra verification procedure after booking was unusual and a first for me after numerous stays with Airbnb. Overall, we were very comfortable here and would love to return to Indy and stay here again."

1230 Union Street,2024-05-19,5,Vrbo,Beautifully renovated property,"The home was very nicely renovated with high end finishes. It was stocked with all the necessary necessities plus a few extras like shampoo, conditioner and body wash. We played the games they had in the basement. Parking on the street was frustrating but there were no driveways attached to any property on the street so we had no choice. The only complaint would be the neighbor with dogs in cages that barked non stop in the backyard. They also had guineas and chickens that cackled all day & night. Again, out of control of the property owner but still annoying.
We would definitely stay here again if we were coming to Indiana!!"

The rooms/living spaces in the house were all incredibly spacious and kept very clean!

Keep in contact with the owners and you'll have an enjoyable stay as they are responsive and communicative. Thank you again && be well.

2836 N. Washington ,2025-03-30,5,Airbnb,,"Fantastic Airbnb! The listing was exactly as described, and communication was seamless. I felt a bit needy at times—like when we used the code on the wrong door—but they responded quickly and kindly. A water main break happened nearby, they were super helpful in confirming we weren’t in the water boil zone. We also noticed the dishwasher was open when we got home one night, which felt a little odd, but they promptly reassured us that it naturally opens after running. Sure enough, it happened again the next day—no big deal. Overall, a very pleasant stay!"
330 E Caven,2024-06-16,5,Airbnb,,"Great house! Love the pet-friendliness! It was clean and spacious. The neighborhood is very industrial, and definitely undergoing a change. We felt safe, but no restaurants nearby. Still, we will stay here again."

Everything from communications to hospitality was done with such care and thoughtfulness. My bed was so comfortable I could have slept all day. Everything was spotlessly clean. Her dog was incredibly sweet and a joy. I love that the home was centrally located to many places and parking off street was a big plus. I look forward to staying here again on my next trip back! Thank you Kathy!

5827 North College,2025-05-07,5,Airbnb,,"Our stay here was one of my favorites in Indianapolis so far. The kitchen was VERY well stocked. We have dietary restrictions and so having a kitchen that was ready for us & functional was amazing. It eliminated all of the “eating out” issues we usually face when traveling. Kathy was responsive to any questions we had, and even offered to help us find sticks for roasting s’mores! I am environmentally sensitive, and this home was an A+ in my book! Thanks again!"

Pleasant ,2024-06-30,5,Airbnb,,"Our group of 5 adults and 5 children had a wonderful stay at this home!   The pictures are exactly what the home looks like.   The host was very responsive, helpful and accommodating.   We asked for a crock pot prior to our stay and they made sure to have one in the kitchen.   When we arrived, we realized we needed more bath towels and some arrived within minutes.     The garage was very accommodating for the 3 vehicles we had.   The roof top deck was awesome and we loved hanging out there!   The kids thought the house was so cool especially the basement.  We would definitely recommend this home and stay here again.<br/>To get to the bunk bed room, you do have to go through the green bed room.   We didn't realize and it did make it tricky having 4 boys in there, could be convenient if a family had little ones.   The kitchen does lack some items so we had to get creative since we cooked there a lot but we were able to make it work!"

The backyard was thoughtfully designed: because of the shade, we were able to sit outside and enjoy the breeze even on a very hot summer day. The neighborhood was quiet. Beds were very comfortable - even the twin beds. The walk-in shower and grab bars in the primary bath were a great bonus for the two 70+-year-olds we had on our trip. I can't think of one thing to complain about with this house! We found a walking trail not far from the house that paralleled  the main road and led to a cute coffee shop. Lots of good restaurants really close by, and easy access to a grocery store and any amenities you'd want. In short, this place was perfect!"

4452 Carrollton,2023-01-02,5,Airbnb,,"It is a wonderful home in a great neighborhood. We could easily live in the house. The stairs are a bit steep if you are older, but at 63, no issue. The comfort level was great and super quiet, even on New Years. Parking on the street can be ok, but 2 parking places in the back are more than adequate. Lots of neighbors alley park with nice cars so no worries. The fence is secure if you have dogs, and doggie bags are provided. Better than average cookware and utensils. Everything we needed except food!"
5827 North College,2024-08-05,5,Airbnb,,"Amazing location for walking, running and dining. Absolutely beautiful. Home was lovely and unusually well stocked for an air bnb."
1620 Walden Court,2024-05-26,5,Airbnb,,Great spot!  Zionsville is a great town to bring your family for any event in Indianapolis. Great restaurants close and plenty to do. One of our friends took the kids to the Children’s Museum and we attended the Indy 500 (short drive to the track). Would recommend to anyone looking for 5-6 people to stay in the Indianapolis area.
N. New Jersey ,2025-01-08,2,Airbnb,,"Nice area, conveniently located. Spacious home which was perfect for our work trip. <br/>But, overall pretty beat up and soul-less. We didnt realize this was owned by a company, not an individual. Lots of cheap fixes and finishes. Nails in the floorboards were sticking up and ripped our socks. The coffee maker is broken. There was a dead bug in one of the beds. The master bathroom had an unpleasant sewer smell. Running the water did help that though, so that was nice. <br/>Lots of specific rules and potential fees in a mandatory contract that needs to be signed before checking in. <br/>Just didnt match up with the expextations from description, highly edited photos, or price point."
College ,2023-07-04,5,Airbnb,,"Great home and had a great time! Just need more television instead of 1 in the living room. Also, needs a bigger iron board. The back door lock always locks i wish i knew how to keep it from doing that! Overall i would give it 4.5 out of 5 stars!"

2834 N. Washington ,2023-05-28,5,Airbnb,,"This was a very well appointed place. Plenty of stuff in the kitchen: pots and pans, utensils, dinnerware and silverware. There was dish soap, laundry soap, dryer most of the stuff we needed. The internet access was fine. We were very comfortable and convenient to all the things we needed. One thing to note is that there's two units in the same building, and the walls are pretty thin. We knew when our neighbors arrived, and they probably knew when we did. Sound also traveled pretty readily from one room to the next, so just be aware if that kind of thing bothers you. Would definitely visit again if we're staying in Indianapolis!"
2836 N. Washington ,2023-04-23,5,Airbnb,,The house felt just like home. My family and I enjoyed the time together we spend at the house. We liked how you the essential basic needs as if we were just moved into the house. By the way we LOVED 🥰 the home decorations and color scheme.

Higdon Ct.,2025-04-06,5,Airbnb,,"Gabe and KiKi are the owners of Brentwood. They were awesome to rent from. Great and proactive communication. The place served it's purpose for my family's needs for the weekend we were there. Place looks just like the pictures. Nice furnishings. Place could use some updates. I'm sure that will come with time. Overall, great experience working with Gabe & KiKi. I recommend renting from them."

Unit 110,2022-11-06,4,Airbnb,,"Gabriel is very helpful and accommodating, and though the building is old- the apartment is clean and affordable. This is a great place to stay if you have a layover in Indy. However, it might be helpful to note that the neighborhood is a bit rough. The apartment upstairs can be a bit loud, and there was a man screaming obscenities outside the unit n the middle of the night when we were there. This is not the host’s fault, but thought it might be good to note for future stays."
Mitchell St,2025-02-06,5,Airbnb,,Had a few repair issues while there and we’re right on it.  Also needed to extend dates a few times.  Always responsive and friendly.
5827 North College,2019-06-10,4,Airbnb,,"I stayed with Kathy for 10 nights while visiting my brother. The location was quiet, safe and close to amenities. Her dog Mac was sweet, and would come sit outside with me for breakfast and once jumped on my bed to snuggle when I  left the door open. Kathy is friendly and accommodating and even facilitated the cooking of a dog birthday cake! I felt that the stay was good value for the money."

College ,2024-09-17,4,Vrbo,Beautiful house in a transitioning neighborhood,This was a beautiful house that seemed to have been recently renovated. The rooms were very nice and clean. Comfortable living space with a beautiful backyard. The house if situated on a busy main road. The neighborhood seems to be transitioning with a lot of houses under renovation. Some homes in the area are vacant which makes the area seem not as nice. The main house however is very nice.
5827 North College,2019-12-20,5,Airbnb,,Kathy was one of the best hosts I’ve had. She was very accommodating and easy to communicate with. Her home is super clean and the perfect place to stay in.
4452 Carrollton,2024-06-23,5,Airbnb,,"We had a great stay at Brentwood's place!  It was very clean, and very homey. The beds were super comfortable (firm mattresses, in a good way!) We did have an issue with the front door not unlocking with our code one time, but we were able to get in the side door. Brentwood was responsive when we had questions. We didn't end up using the fire pit in the backyard, but it seemed very nice. It did take us a minute to find the on-site parking, since the parking and driveway are accessed by a back lane. It would have been nice if this had been clearer in the directions. We were also a little surprised that there want a TV in the living room upstairs. The TV in the den in the basement was nice though, so it worked out. The neighborhood was very cute, with lots of little Indiana bungalows, and carefully tended gardens. Some good restaurants and fun places for a drink are only a short walk away, along with the Monon trail. Would definitely stay here again!"

Property is very clean, beds are heavenly to sleep on, the property manager is very responsive and makes sure you have all the information you need and available to answer any questions should you have them during your stay. My husband had a medical emergency while we were there and they were very kind and reached out to make sure he was doing ok. Would highly recommend this property to anyone for a long or short term stay."

Gandy,2024-12-13,4,Airbnb,,"Great for a night or two, but would have liked something a bit nicer for a long term stay.<br/>This property has everything it advertised, however the quality for the price was a bit disappointing. Management did nothing wrong, it’s just not the level of quality if you are going to stay for an extended period of time.<br/>The quality of furniture, kitchen pieces, and bath are all Amazon/Walmart basics, making them easily worn after many stays. Again, for a short term stay we would have been perfectly happy and I would have given it a higher score, but given we stayed for a month it wasn’t the most comfortable.<br/>That being said, any and every issue we did have management was incredibly responsive and quick to remedy any issues."

We had my elderly mother with us, and it looked like there was a bedroom on the first floor, but we weren't sure beforehand.  Also, a full bath on the first floor would have improved our stay.  "

So close to the Lucas Oil Stadium huge plus point!! <br/>The house doesn't have a lot of close parking on the street, but we made it work. The house was PRISTINE! Exactly how it looks in the pictures.<br/> It rained the whole time we were there so didn't get to enjoy the backyard.. but it was nice to know that it was there. <br/>Only downfalls we had was the walls are pretty thin, you could hear every step from the neighbors, and the the parking. The neighbors did not ride together and had 3 vehicles, they would park right out front so we had to park in different areas. Not exactly ideal when traveling with elderly people. May want to establish parking rules or at least tell us where there is safe overflow parking. <br/>Overall if we come back for BOA we will be trying for this place again!"

Host was responsive, property was clean & ready for us when we arrived at our check in time. It would have been convenient to have more than six towels provided for our four night stay. Kitchen was lacking some basic items, can opener, pot holders, dish towel and dish cloth. However, there is a Walmart located near the property that we were able to pick up additional items as needed. I will stay here again when I visit family in Indianapolis in the future."

It was the perfect size & had all of the amenities that we needed. It was also super nice to have a fenced in back yard, as well as a deck. The screened in front porch was also a nice bonus. 

I definitely recommend this house & location."
Unit 262,2023-03-22,5,Airbnb,,The place was like a home away from home. Didn’t have any problems with it or getting in. It’s pretty close to everything.
4452 Carrollton,2024-08-17,5,Airbnb,,Very nice place to stay and great for walking to the state fair grounds. Also very close to some nice restaurants and plenty of things to do in the area. Host was very responsive and the place was very accommodating.
305 Parkway,2024-05-05,4,Airbnb,,"No address identifier on back of residence where private parking was located.  Landscaping could be improved by cleaning up the back entrance with a cemented walk way. There was no dish soap, and instructions asked to put dishes in the dishwasher however there were no dishpods. Also, most airbnbs I have done don't require you to take out trash so we thought that was odd given the additional fees we pay. Additionally, one of the chairs in the living room had broken straps. <br/>Biggest issue we had with the place was that the weekend we stayed it was humid and high 70s and the air conditioning worked well downstairs however it was non-existent upstairs where 3 of the 4 bedrooms were situated making it a rather uncomfortable sleeping situation. Sliding glass door and screen door in the master bedroom didn't lock (had a pipe to hold it shut), but still not very comfortable. <br/>The place has a lot of potential and is located near wonderful neighborhoods and we overall enjoyed our stay."

Brentwood Property Group,2024-06-05,5,Google,,"I use Brentwood to manage my out of state mid-term rentals and would recommend Brentwood to anyone in the area. Gabe & his team go the extra mile to manage the entire process of finding tenants & screening tenants, managing turnover, providing updates, and helping find price effective solutions to inevitable capital and operating expenditures. Best of all, they are digitized and have invested in software to manage rentals so that you have transparency into accounting."

The other reviews mention the dogs nextdoor. Yes they are barkers but they did stop with a little shushing and thier owner tried to keep them quiet also. 
Check in and out was super easy. Theres laundrly unit available inside. They even had high chairs for little ones, extra air beds also. Everything needed for the kitchen was available. If we ever needed to return to Indianapolis we would stay here. Good size for up to 6 people. Everything was super clean and  cozy with lots of room. Could have walked to downtown."
1301 Ringgold,2024-06-21,4,Airbnb,,"The home was in a great location very close to Fountain Square. The home has a lot of space, it just needs some care. It has been well lived in and needs a paint job and new couch in the living room. The kitchen is very nice, but needs to be organized for someone who wants to cook. We could not find a several kitchen items we needed. The hot tub was dirty and offered little privacy with the neighbor in the backyard able to see you while you sit outside. Overall the house is great, just needs some attention."

I would stay here again, and would book with this host every time! Thanks for letting me stay."
848 Camp St,2024-11-03,5,Airbnb,,"Brentwood's property was the perfect home base for my sisters and I to stay as we were in town for the Eras Tour! Enough bedrooms and space to get ready, and they had the cutest welcome package with Taylor Swift-themed goodies, such a nice, personal touch. Their location is perfect, as it's close to downtown (so a very quick drive to Lucas Oil) and also walkable to a strip mall with Starbucks, Jimmy John's, a liquor store, and more. The place was clean, updated and cozy."
42 S Holmes,2024-09-25,5,Airbnb,,Stay was great!
Unit 110,2023-03-26,5,Airbnb,,Gabriel is an excellent host. I stayed here while my grandson was at Riley’s and needed to extend at the last minute and Gabriel quickly responded and was extremely compassionate. Thank you Gabriel!  I will definitely use if I have to return.
Sanders,2024-12-09,5,Vrbo,Lucas Oil Stadium Weekend ,"The property was as represented, it was clean and had what we needed for a weekend stay.

Senour,2024-04-10,5,Airbnb,,"The house was faithful to the description and the listing photos. The house had plenty of room. The five bedrooms were all good sized and “real” bedrooms, with real beds. The kitchen was large and the appliances all worked. Two full baths upstairs but only a small half bath down. Downstairs bedroom would need to go upstairs to shower. The dining room table seats only six. That was all we needed, but a larger group would want more. A larger dining room table and upgraded chairs would be a good investment. The host was responsive to questions and requests. The area is rural, but close to an interstate leading downtown. 20 minutes to city center. There is a really good Thai restaurant (Baan Thai) and a really good bar/restaurant in Wanamaker 5 minutes away. Who would have guessed?"

341 Parkway,2023-10-08,4,Airbnb,,"Brentwood's place was great, very spacious and comfy. The only bad part were the step stairs to get to the rooms. There is a room down stairs which made up for it, oh and it has a king bed upstairs that was a plus. We did run into a couple of issues with the amenities and the host responded a bit rudely on an occasion. But overall it was a great stay. I would definitely recommend to anyone and everyone."

Brentwood Property Group,2024-02-05,5,Google,,"Gabe Chase and Brentwood Property Group has been doing a wonderful job! As a Short Term Rental owner, I needed someone who is highly dedicated and pays attention to every detail for optimal customer satisfaction, and Gabe was the absolute best person for that. As a new STR owner, I also needed some education and he was really good at that too. He is a very patient and courteous property manager and jumps into any maintenance issues right away. Gabe and Brentwood Property also provide STR setup / furnishing services and they do a great job at that too, saving the owners a lot of time and resources. Highly recommend!"

Sanders,2023-09-23,5,Airbnb,,"I was so happy that this home exceeded our expectations. It housed two families with young kids very comfortably. We had plenty of room for the kids to play indoors or out in the spacious backyard. We needed close access to Downtown Indianapolis each day, & it was only 6 minutes away from the convention center. The house was clean, had several amenities, exactly as described, & the host checked in often & responded quickly. This will be the first home I look for if I'm ever needing to stay in the area again!"

Had one small issue with the garbage disposal during my stay, and the host was very responsive and sent someone out to fix it right away - and in my schedule."
5827 North College,2019-05-04,5,Airbnb,,"Great location for Broad Ripple excursions!  Fantastic recommendations for dining - we went to all of them.  In all, despite constant rain (which I believe Kathy had no control over); it was a warm, cozy, and friendly stay."

Sanders,2022-12-18,5,Airbnb,,"I’ve used airbnb for several years now, I would rate this home high on my list of amazing stays. Parking was convenient, outside and inside appearance of home very modern, open air concept was very flattering, convenient half bath downstairs, fully stocked and well equipped kitchen, private backyard, extra garage parking safe a secure, fresh carpet throughout upstairs, bedrooms spacious, beds very comfortable and plus like, natural light throughout the entire house."
1232 Union Street,2024-11-30,5,Airbnb,,"This was the cleanest place I've ever rented. Nice bright lighting throughout. It was a nice touch to have the dog bowls and towel near the back door as my girls came in from outside.  Backyard was very nice, but too cold outside for us to enjoy it properly.  Nice space to let the dogs run around.<br/>There were adequate plates and utensils for 3 people not to have to run the dishwasher until we left.<br/>The connecting wall to the other side of the duplex is rather thin, as mentioned in other reviews.  You can't quite hear conversations if it's quiet, but can certainly tell when the folks on the other side are talking.  And they were very quiet neighbors!<br/>There are no hangers anywhere, so bring your own if you want to hang clothes up.<br/>The location is very good - close driving (1-2 miles) the both downtown and the Fountain Square area.<br/>The folks at Brentwood are excellent communicators, helpful, and respond super fast."

44 S Holmes,2024-06-02,3,Airbnb,,"The house itself was nice, newly renovated and up to date. Only problems, the neighborhood felt unsafe, someone tried selling us drugs. The neighbors dogs/roosters were constantly making noise. Very limited parking, if you have large vehicles, I don’t recommend. We also had multiple encounters with bugs, specifically with cockroaches. We also had noticed bugs crawling on the table runner (dining room table)."
10th St,2024-10-16,5,Airbnb,,Really enjoyed my stay! The host is very responsive and quickly helped with a couple of small issues. It's a great middle point for the Mass Ave and Windsor Park neighborhoods. Street parking was the only option but I was able to always find a really close spot! I'd definitely stay there again.
Senour,2024-05-06,4,Vrbo,Property Needs Care,"Interior of the home was as listed and accurate. The exterior needs a lot attention. Grass was around 18"" tall, the trash cans were overflowing, and there was debris on the roof. Some basic lot maintenance would help the appeal of this location - currently, the first impressions are quite bad until you go inside."
Pleasant ,2024-09-23,5,Airbnb,,We were in Indy for my sons wedding and this house was perfect. Plenty of room to house and sleep our entire family of 8 comfortably.

5827 North College,2018-11-08,5,Airbnb,,"This location is outstanding in all respects and really the optimal shared room vibe which is hard to achieve.  Kathy has great taste and style and nice amenities for morning coffee, etc.  Off street parking on busy College Ave is a plus but easier to see both address and driveway in daylight.  I've stayed at six or seven AirBNBs in Indianapolis area and this was the best of the bunch."
Brentwood Property Group,2024-04-18,1,Google,,Beware! I rented a airbnd property managed by this company. Charged over a hundred $$ of extra fees for nonsense claims. Defensive to any input about difficulties or limited amenities. Not recommended

The house is beautifully decorated, clean and the living area felt even bigger than the photos. We were in town for a basketball tournament and it was an easy 20ish min walk to Gainbridge Fieldhouse. It is a similar walking distance to Lucas Oil Stadium as well as a lot of great restaurants and bars. We walked home late in the evening and felt safe. There were two couples and one mother/son combo so the bedroom organization worked perfectly for our group. If I am back in Indy, I would definitely try to rent this property again."

1230 Union Street,2024-11-10,4,Airbnb,,"This place is fantastic. A beautiful remodeled home. The communication was great with host and the pictures looked just like the home. No surprises.  The only weekend I am giving it 4 stars and not 5 is that the neighbors are pot heads, so the area smells like pot.  They put their dog out at all times of the night and barks and cries.  I think they have a chicken coop too and their roosters will wake you up."
44 S Holmes,2022-12-10,5,Airbnb,,"The house was exactly as shown in photos, everything was nice and clean. You can tell its been recently remodeled. The neighborhood is a bit noisy, and has alot of potential for improvement. Obviously the host has no control over this, and I would not hesitate to stay here again on my next trip."
1230 Union Street,2025-02-23,2,Vrbo,Sound proofing needed,"To start the place was as advertised. The appearance is great, and the place was clean. The neighborhood was a little sketchy. There was plenty of street parking. The negative was there is 0 sound proofing on this duplex. The other side was rented, and we could hear everything from music, conversations, cabinets closing, and even individuals walking down the hallway.  This led to 0 sleep as the renters on the other side came home at 3 am and extended their evening until about 5 am.  We decided we needed to leave the rental due to the neighbors. They were hanging out the window smoking weed as we left around 12 pm.  If you rent this place, you better hope for no neighbors or you will hear everything they do.  Additionally, the mattress in the primary is very firm and tough to sleep on.  A management company is operating this rental as well as an FYI. "
Colere Place,2025-01-20,5,Airbnb,,Brand new townhouse minutes from downtown very clean and lots of space. we were traveling for our daughter's sports and this location was very convenient to the convention center and restaurants. Highly recommend for those traveling with a family or two.

The neighborhood felt plenty safe, check-in was easy, and we loved the close proximity to Half Liter BBQ & Beer Hall (highly recommend). Overall, no major issues but would not stay here again if I’m being truthful.<br/>A few call outs for future guests:<br/>- while this is a dog friendly property, definitely still look around before letting your pup explore. We found a sewing needle on the carpet in the living room, a few pieces of trash in the backyard, side gate was open upon our arrival (thankfully our dog didn’t escape), and we can confirm with previous reviews that there are indeed stickers in the backyard that are hard to get out of dog paws & fur<br/>- many of the electrical outlets don’t work, including the bathroom so have fun straightening your hair in the kitchen (definitely a first for me)<br/>- security cameras in front & back of house and some different Ring device on the windowsill of the bedroom we stayed in.

N. New Jersey ,2022-12-11,5,Airbnb,,"Beautiful home in a historical area. Peaceful, safe street with nice neighbors, walkable to a grocery store and restaurants. Downtown restaurants were very close too but you get the benefit of a quiet neighborhood.  House is spotless with everything you could need for a long or short stay.  We were just there for a night but really enjoyed our short stay."
Woodland,2025-03-09,5,Airbnb,,"This was an excellent place to stay.  Stores were close and the host was very accommodating.   <br/>Bed was extremely comfortable and there were extra wash cloths.  Best of all, the host had snacks (microwave popcorn and oatmeal) available as a courtesy."

4452 Carrollton,2022-12-19,5,Airbnb,,"I needed a quick staycation. Being an Indianapolis native, I have always loved going to the south Broad Ripple / Butler-Tarkington area, with its rich history and calm surroundings. It's close to downtown and all that the city has to offer without all of the hustle and intensity of the city. This house is everything! I spent a few solid hours on the piano composing, watched a couple of movies down in the basement, went on a couple of runs and walks to restaurants (Cafe Patachou is one of my favorite local spots!)... truly a wonderful and relaxing weekend. Thank you, Gabe and crew!"
Sanders,2023-06-09,5,Airbnb,,"This is a nicely laid out house with great space and all the basics well covered. We particularly like the privacy of the garage and garden and a large, comfortable sofa. Nothing to complain about at all. We returned once already and will do so again."
341 Parkway,2023-10-15,5,Airbnb,,"Place was great! No qualms, it was as advertised. Great location, great price, and overall a fantastic place to stay. 10/10 if I’m visiting Indianapolis again I will see if this location is available to rent again!"
